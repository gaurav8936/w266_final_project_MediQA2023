# Advancing Clinical NLP with RoBERTa & BART
##From Classification to Summarization: Unveiling New Insights

### Description
This repository hosts the materials for the research project titled "Advancing Clinical NLP with RoBERTa & BART", which focuses on the classification and summarization of medical dialogues using advanced NLP techniques.

### Repository Structure
* 01.Paper_Submitted: Contains the final paper submitted for the project.
* 02.Shortlist_Notebooks_for_Paper: A curated collection of Jupyter notebooks integral to the development of the final paper.
* 10.TaskA_Summarization_Metrics: Notebooks and resources related to tracking the progression of summarization metrics in Task A.
* 11.Source_Data: The raw data used in the project.
* 12.SBert_Embeddings_Dialogue: Evaluating SBert embeddings and their impact on the dialogue data.
* 13.Instructor_Embeddings_Dialogue: Evaluating Instructor Embeddings and their impact on the dialogue data.

In the main directory, you will find a comprehensive list of key notebooks, each named in a date, step, topic format for easy navigation and understanding of the project's progression.

*** Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive effort to push the boundaries of clinical NLP by focusing on medical dialogue classification and summarization. Aligned with the MediQA2023-Chat challenge, it demonstrates how to achieve competitive NLP results under constraints such as limited computational resources and stringent data privacy requirements.

### Getting Started
To delve into this project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Explore the directories for notebooks, data, and the final paper.
3. The notebooks follow a systematic naming convention (date, step, topic) for ease of access and understanding.
4. Requirements
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Relevant libraries as outlined in the notebooks (e.g., pandas, NumPy, SBert)
