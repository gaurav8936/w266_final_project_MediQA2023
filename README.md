>  w266_final_project_MediQA2023

### Description
This repository hosts the materials for the research project titled "Advancing Clinical NLP with RoBERTa & BART", which focuses on the classification and summarization of medical dialogues using advanced NLP techniques.

### Repository Structure
* 01.Paper_Submitted: Contains the final paper submitted for the project.
* 02.Shortlist_Notebooks_for_Paper: A curated collection of Jupyter notebooks integral to the development of the final paper.
* 03.Notebooks_by_Step: Contains primary notebooks for each step of the analysis (the Archive folder is not uploaded). 
* 10.Tracking_Metrics: Csv files generated to follow the performance of different models.
* 11.Source_Data: The raw data used in the project.
* 13.Instructor_Embeddings_Dialogue: Evaluating Instructor Embeddings and their impact on the dialogue data.

A comment on the naming convention for all notebooks. I generally follow a date-step-topic-version structure with data in the yyyymmdd format. This makes it visually easier to follow the progression of analysis especially when projects transition from one calendar year to the next.

### Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive effort to push the boundaries of clinical NLP by focusing on medical dialogue classification and summarization. Aligned with the MediQA2023-Chat challenge, it demonstrates how to achieve competitive NLP results under constraints such as limited computational resources and stringent data privacy requirements.

### Getting Started
To delve into this project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Explore the directories for notebooks, data, and the final paper.
3. The notebooks follow a systematic naming convention (date, step, topic) for ease of access and understanding.
4. Requirements
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Relevant libraries as outlined in the notebooks (e.g., pandas, NumPy, SBert)
