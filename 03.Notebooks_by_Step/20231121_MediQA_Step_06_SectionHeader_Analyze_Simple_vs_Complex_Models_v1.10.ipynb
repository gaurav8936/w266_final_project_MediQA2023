    "Preprocessing:\n",
    "Text cleaning (removal of special characters and digits, converting to lowercase, removing stopwords).\n",
    "Text length normalization.\n",
    "Tokenization using RoBERTa's tokenizer.\n",
    "Dataset Preparation: Similar to Section 2 but with added cleaning steps.\n",

    "Class weights are calculated and used in a custom loss function.\n",
    "Custom Trainer class to use the modified loss function.\n",
    "Inference: Custom inference function to handle dataset and model.\n",
    "Potential Issues and Redundancies in Section 3\n",
    "Text Preprocessing:\n",
    "\n",
    "The text cleaning steps (removing special characters, lowercase conversion, and removing stopwords) might be removing valuable information, especially medical terms that are crucial for classification.\n",
    "Length normalization might lead to loss of context, especially for longer medical conversations.\n",
    "Class Weights in Loss Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "While using class weights can be beneficial for imbalanced datasets, it can also lead to the model overfitting to minority classes.\n",
    "This approach requires careful tuning and validation to ensure it improves performance.\n",
    "Custom Trainer:\n",
    "\n",
    "The custom trainer and loss computation add complexity but may not be necessary. RoBERTa is already a powerful model that handles text classification well with the standard loss function.\n",
    "Model Initialization:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Section 3, the model is initialized from a configuration but does not explicitly use a pretrained model (RobertaForSequenceClassification(config)). This means it starts from scratch rather than using a pretrained base, which is a significant disadvantage.\n",
    "Suggestions for Improvement\n",
    "Simplify Preprocessing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Test the model performance without extensive text preprocessing. RoBERTa's tokenizer is already quite capable of handling various textual nuances.\n",
    "Reconsider Class Weights:\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluate if the class weights are genuinely improving performance or leading to overfitting. You might try a model without them or adjust the weighting strategy.\n",
    "Use Pretrained Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure you are using a pretrained model (RobertaForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('roberta-base', num_labels=num_labels)) to leverage transfer learning.\n",
    "Standard Training Procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider using the standard training procedure (as in Section 2) unless there's clear evidence that the custom approach significantly improves performance.\n",
    "Evaluate Data Quality and Distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assess if there's any issue with data quality or distribution that might be affecting the model's performance.\n",
    "Hyperparameter Tuning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment with different hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, number of epochs) to find the optimal configuration.\n",
    "Experiment with Other Models:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the medical nature of the dataset, experimenting with medically-oriented models like BioClinical BERT or PubMedBERT could yield better results."
