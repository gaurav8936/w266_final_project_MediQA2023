He works in the flint and it is really hot where he works and it has been quite humid lately.  The third problem is that he has a wart or a spot that he thinks is a wart on the right middle finger.  He is interested in getting that frozen today.  Apparently, he tells me I froze a previous wart on him in the past and it went away.  Next, he is interested in getting some blood test done.  He specifically mentions the blood test for his prostate, which I informed him is called the PSA.  He is 50 years old now.  He will also be getting his cholesterol checked again because he has a history of high cholesterol.  He made a big difference in his cholesterol by quitting smoking, but unfortunately after taking his social history today he tells me that he is back to smoking.  He says it is difficult to quit.

Patient: I was referred by a doctor to come see you so that you could check up on my nasal problems. Here is my report from my previous doctor who referred me to you. 
Doctor: Thank you. Let me take a look.  I see here it says you had severe sinusitis two to three months ago, correct? 
Patient:  Is that what they're calling my nasal problems? 
Doctor: Yeah, it is. Sinusitis is the inflammation of your nasal airways. 
Patient: I see. Thank you for describing it to me. 
Doctor: No problem. Would you be able to describe to me what you had been feeling two to three months ago? 
Patient: Yeah, I can. My face would feel uncomfortable, my nose was stuffy, my eyes hurt, and I felt something dropping in the back of my throat.
Doctor: Have you ever been prescribed any medication? 
Patient: Here's the list of medicine I was taking. 
Doctor: I see you were given antibiotics, correct? 
Patient: I was, but I don't know what those are. Could you explain them to me? 
Doctor: Antibiotics are usually used to fight infections. 
Patient: I had an infection? I thought I just had some nasal problems. 
Doctor: Your report states you had a severe infection. Do you remember if the antibiotics helped? 
Patient: Not really. I felt like my symptoms were the same. 
Doctor: I see. Did your doctor order any advanced imaging's? 
Patient: Yeah. They did a C T scan of my nose. Here is the report from my C T scan. 
Doctor: Let me take a look. It looks like you had some thickening of the mucosal layer in your right paranasal sinus. You also had some obstruction in your right ostiomeatal complex and excess growing of some of the bones in your nose. Uhm. Oh, one more thing. I see your nasal septum was shifted to the left. 
Patient: Oh, wow. Thank you for explaining everything to me. 
Doctor: No problem. Going back to your list of medications, I know you took antibiotics for your infection, but did you take any medication for your sinuses? 
Patient: No, I haven't. I did try this cream for my nose, but that didn't work either. Nothing worked! 
Doctor: I see. Looks like the cream you used was a topical nasal corticosteroid. Are there any other symptoms that you have been experiencing? 
Patient: I've had some trouble with my balance, and I feel like I've lost some of my hearing. I thought this was odd since I'm only fifty years old. I think my ears felt plugged or full of air, so they just needed to pop. 
Doctor: I see. Let's perform an audiogram test to check your ears. 
Patient: Sounds good. 
Doctor: I'm seeing that you have some mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Your tympanometry seems to be normal. Your speech discrimination was also normal. 
Patient: That's reassuring. 
Doctor: I want to ask a few more questions about your ears. Do you feel any fullness or pressure?  
Patient: No, I don't feel anything like that right now. 
Doctor: Do you hear any humming, buzzing, or roaring sounds?
Patient: Nope. I don't hear anything like that. 
Doctor: We checked your ears and now understand more about the problem, but I wonder why your balance is affected. When did you start noticing your balance was affected? 
Patient: I think it could have been to this one medicine that starts with an A. I forgot the name, but it didn't really help my nasal problems. It just made my balance worse. 
Doctor: Was the medicine called Allegra? 
Patient: Oh, yeah. That's what it was called. I thought I had some sort of allergy, so I thought it would help. 
Doctor: I see. Did you ever feel any dizziness too? 
Patient: Yeah, I did. 
Doctor: I will have you do some movements to see if your dizziness occurs. 
Patient: Sounds good. 
Doctor: Could you look to the left and then look to the right. 
Patient: Oh, wow. That made me very dizzy.

She has tried topical nasal corticosteroid therapy without much improvement.  She tried Allegra without much improvement and she believes the Allegra may have caused problems with balance to worsen.

Patient: Hello! It is nice to meet you. 
Doctor: What brings you into see me today? 
Patient: I have had this weakness in my right leg for quite some time now.
Doctor: How long has this been going on and do you know how you injured yourself?
Patient: I think that it was about six months ago that the weakness in my leg started. I don't really remember how it happened. 
Doctor: Can you tell me what you do remember? 
Patient: I was reaching to get something from a cabinet, and I noticed that I was unable to stand on my right toe. Ever since then I have had difficulty pushing off when walking.  My toes were tingling and numb.
Doctor: Was the numbness and tingling mild, moderate, or severe? 
Patient: It was a mild feeling, but this has been an ongoing problem that has been the same since the weakness started. 
Doctor: Have you had any other pain any where else in your body? 
Patient: I have had back pain, but this has been going on for many years and has not changed.  
Doctor: Is the back pain been mild, moderate, or severe? 
Patient: I would say mild. I have also been having cramping in both calves. 
Doctor: How long has that been going on? 
Patient: For the past year but it stopped about two months ago.  
Doctor: Have you had any weakness in the left leg? 
Patient: No. I don't think so. 
Doctor: Have you had any pain around right leg and the area of numbness and tingling? 
Patient: No. Everything that is going on with my right leg has pretty much been the same since it started six months ago. I have not gotten worse or better. 
Doctor: Have you had any bowel or bladder incontinence? Any radicular pain?
Patient: No.
Doctor: When did you first see a doctor for the issue? I remember that you told me you saw a different provider prior to coming to see me.
Patient:  I saw the other doctor in October. That was a couple of months before I came to see you. 
Doctor: I see in your chart that we did a CT scan that shows degenerative changes, but nothing obviously abnormal. Remind me why we did not do a MRI of your spine? 
Patient: I cannot have an MRI because of my ear implant.  
Doctor: That is unfortunate. It looks like we were able to do an EMG and nerve conduction studies. What medications are you taking currently? 
Patient: I had an elevated CK before I started taking stat medications.
Doctor: What medications are those? 
Patient: I am not taking Lipitor anymore. I think I took it for about fifteen months. 
Doctor: Do you know what your levels of your CK were before you started taking medication? 
Patient: I thought that my CK was in the five hundred or six hundreds prior to starting it. Once I started it, my levels increased to about eight hundred and then came down to about five hundred again when it was stopped. I recently stopped taking Lipitor because my levels were up to the thousand's and then my CK apparently has returned to about the five hundreds or six hundreds.

Doctor: Have your symptoms improved at all since they began? 
Patient: No, they keep getting worse. 
Doctor: Does the pain radiate into your legs? 
Patient: Yes, it started radiating down my right leg three days after the lower back pain began, and then the left leg three days after the right. The next day I could barely walk, the pain was so severe. 
Doctor: Do you remember the initial date of the beginning of your low back pain? 
Patient: Um, it was on December third nineteen ninety five. 
Doctor: Have you seen another doctor for this pain? 
Patient: Yes, I saw my local physician, um, it was on December eleventh, but he wasn't able to pinpoint what was going on. 
Doctor: What kind of treatments did he recommend? 
Patient: He gave me some antiinflammatories and sent me on my way. 
Doctor: Did you drive yourself?

Doctor: Was there any leg numbness? 
Patient: Yes. Since December eleventh. 
Doctor:  Have you seen an orthopedist for this pain? 
Patient: Yes, I saw one the day after my primary care physician, but my legs gave out and I fell while walking to my car because of the leg weakness and back pain.

Patient: Right now, I work at Taco Bell. I have a workers comp claim open.
Doctor: Your pain came back while working there, correct? 
Patient: Yes, that's correct. 
Doctor: Do you remember when your last appointment here was? 
Patient: Um, yes, it was on April twelfth two thousand five. 
Doctor: With ten being the worst pain imaginable, what was your pain out of ten at your last visit? 
Patient: Um, I'd say it was an eight out of ten. 
Doctor: Have you taken any medicine for this? 
Patient: Um, I had a Medrol Dosepak prescribed at my last visit. 
Doctor: How did your pain respond to the Dosepak? 
Patient: It took it down to about a four or five out of ten. 
Doctor: Can you point to me where the pain is, sir? 
Patient: Yes, it's right here. 
Doctor: This band right here? 
Patient: Yeah, that's the spot. 
Doctor: Okay, this is between your L four and sacrum. How would you describe your right leg pain?
Patient: I'd say it's intermittent and minimal now, it's not always there. 
Doctor: Have you ever had back surgery? 
Patient: Um, yes, I've had two laminectomies, one in nineteen ninety and the other was in ninety four. Wait, I also had a discectomy some time in between. 
Doctor: Do you know where the focus was?
Patient: It was at L four L 5. 
Doctor: Have you had any imaging done on the lower back? 
Patient: Yes, I had an M R I on October eighteenth two thousand four. I have the report right here. 
Doctor: Okay, this shows multi level degenerative changes, with facet involvement at L two L three, L three L four, and L five S1, with no neural impingement, which is good. 
Patient: What does that mean, doctor? 
Doctor: In summary, you have a significant amount of arthritis in the back. 
Patient: Oh yeah, I had an M R myelogram as well, here's the report. 
Doctor: Okay, this shows severe spinal stenosis at L three L four, but it may have been artifact. 
Patient: What does that mean? 
Doctor: This finding may be a misinterpretation.",GENHX,"The patient is a 44-year-old man who was seen for complaints of low back and right thigh pain.  He attributes this to an incident in which he was injured in 1994.  I do not have any paperwork authenticating his claim that there is an open claim.  Most recently he was working at Taco Bell, when he had a recurrence of back pain, and he was seen in our clinic on 04/12/05.  He rated pain of approximately 8/10 in severity. He took a Medrol Dosepak and states that his pain level has decreased to approximately 4-5/10.  He still localizes it to a band between L4 and the sacrum.  He initially had some right leg pain but states that this is minimal and intermittent at the present time.  His back history is significant for two laminectomies and a discectomy performed from 1990 to 1994.  The area of concern was L4-L5. The patient's MRI dated 10/18/04 showed multi-level degenerative changes, with facet involvement at L2-L3, L3-L4 and L5-S1.  There was no neural impingement.  He also had an MR myelogram, which showed severe stenosis at L3-L4, however it was qualified in that it may have been artifact, rather than a genuine finding.",0.9483855

Patient: I was reaching to get something from a cabinet, and I noticed that I was unable to stand on my right toe. Ever since then I have had difficulty pushing off when walking.  My toes were tingling and numb.

Guest_family: Is there any surgery to fix this? 
Doctor: Usually, we manage this for six months without surgery, and she hasn't reached that milestone yet. But, because her pain is getting so severe, I can do a lateral capsular release on this knee. 
Guest_family: What is that?
Doctor: It's a small procedure, minimally invasive, and we can do it outpatient. Her kneecap is partially dislocating, so this surgery will get everything back into alignment. 
Guest_family: Okay, what is the risk of infection?
Doctor: The risk of infection is actually less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection.
Patient: Will I be asleep for this?
Doctor: Yes, you won't feel a thing. 
Patient: Will I need to go back to P T?
Doctor: Yes, you'll need to go some after the surgery to make sure everything heals up okay. The other risks include bleeding, changes in sensation and motion extremity, failure of procedure to relieve pain, need for postoperative rehab, and significant postoperative swelling.
Guest_family: I think we'd like to do the surgery. What do you think, honey?
Patient: Yeah, I think so too, I want to get back to playing soccer.

Doctor: It was a lumbar disc replacement. So, how are you feeling today? 
Patient: Truthfully doctor, the surgery did nothing. I'm still in a lot of pain. 
Doctor: Besides the surgery, what other interventions have you tried?
Patient: I have them written down, let me look. Um, I did acupuncture, T E N S unit at P T, and I've been to the chiropractor too. 
Doctor: Have you taken any medicines? 
Patient: Yeah, I have those written down here. I've taken Elavil, Topamax, Cymbalta, Neurontin, and Lexapro.

Doctor: Specifically, what activities make the pain worse? 
Patient: Well, lifting, standing for a long time, or, um, squatting. I can't do that anymore.
Doctor: Does anything make the pain better? 
Patient: Um, sitting back, ice, and I guess there's some improvement with the pain medication. 
Doctor: Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
Patient: It's constant now, but, um, the intensity of it comes and goes. 
Doctor: Are you able to sleep at night?

Patient: I was referred by a doctor to come see you so that you could check up on my nasal problems. Here is my report from my previous doctor who referred me to you. 
Doctor: Thank you. Let me take a look.  I see here it says you had severe sinusitis two to three months ago, correct? 
Patient:  Is that what they're calling my nasal problems? 
Doctor: Yeah, it is. Sinusitis is the inflammation of your nasal airways. 
Patient: I see. Thank you for describing it to me. 
Doctor: No problem. Would you be able to describe to me what you had been feeling two to three months ago? 
Patient: Yeah, I can. My face would feel uncomfortable, my nose was stuffy, my eyes hurt, and I felt something dropping in the back of my throat.
Doctor: Have you ever been prescribed any medication? 
Patient: Here's the list of medicine I was taking. 
Doctor: I see you were given antibiotics, correct? 
Patient: I was, but I don't know what those are. Could you explain them to me? 
Doctor: Antibiotics are usually used to fight infections. 
Patient: I had an infection? I thought I just had some nasal problems. 
Doctor: Your report states you had a severe infection. Do you remember if the antibiotics helped? 
Patient: Not really. I felt like my symptoms were the same. 
Doctor: I see. Did your doctor order any advanced imaging's? 
Patient: Yeah. They did a C T scan of my nose. Here is the report from my C T scan. 
Doctor: Let me take a look. It looks like you had some thickening of the mucosal layer in your right paranasal sinus. You also had some obstruction in your right ostiomeatal complex and excess growing of some of the bones in your nose. Uhm. Oh, one more thing. I see your nasal septum was shifted to the left. 
Patient: Oh, wow. Thank you for explaining everything to me. 
Doctor: No problem. Going back to your list of medications, I know you took antibiotics for your infection, but did you take any medication for your sinuses? 
Patient: No, I haven't. I did try this cream for my nose, but that didn't work either. Nothing worked! 
Doctor: I see. Looks like the cream you used was a topical nasal corticosteroid. Are there any other symptoms that you have been experiencing? 
Patient: I've had some trouble with my balance, and I feel like I've lost some of my hearing. I thought this was odd since I'm only fifty years old. I think my ears felt plugged or full of air, so they just needed to pop. 
Doctor: I see. Let's perform an audiogram test to check your ears. 
Patient: Sounds good. 
Doctor: I'm seeing that you have some mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Your tympanometry seems to be normal. Your speech discrimination was also normal. 
Patient: That's reassuring. 
Doctor: I want to ask a few more questions about your ears. Do you feel any fullness or pressure?  
Patient: No, I don't feel anything like that right now. 
Doctor: Do you hear any humming, buzzing, or roaring sounds?
Patient: Nope. I don't hear anything like that. 
Doctor: We checked your ears and now understand more about the problem, but I wonder why your balance is affected. When did you start noticing your balance was affected? 
Patient: I think it could have been to this one medicine that starts with an A. I forgot the name, but it didn't really help my nasal problems. It just made my balance worse. 
Doctor: Was the medicine called Allegra? 
Patient: Oh, yeah. That's what it was called. I thought I had some sort of allergy, so I thought it would help. 
Doctor: I see. Did you ever feel any dizziness too? 
Patient: Yeah, I did. 
Doctor: I will have you do some movements to see if your dizziness occurs. 
Patient: Sounds good.

Doctor: How long have you had this back and buttock pain? 
Patient: Its been a while, now. I know I have a fracture in my lower back. 
Doctor: How have you been managing this? 
Patient: Another doctor called this conservative treatment. I've been resting a lot, and using antiinflammatories. 
Doctor: Has there been any improvement?
Patient: Its been several months at this point, and honestly no, there's been no improvement. I'm still in a lot of pain.  
Doctor: This C T Scan you had recently shows sclerosis, with some healing of a L five compression fracture, but if you look here, the healing is not complete. 
Patient: What can we do about this? I'm in so much pain. 
Doctor: I believe you'd be a candidate for a bilateral L five kyphoplasty. 
Patient: What's that? 
Doctor: It's a small procedure on that L five vertebra. Its minimally invasive, and we can actually do it as an outpatient procedure. 
Patient: Oh, wow, that's good to hear. What are the risks of infection?
Doctor: Very low, historically, they're less than one percent. 
Patient: How is this possible? 
Doctor: We'll use antibiotics in order to control for infection. 
Patient: That's great, will I be under anesthesia?
Doctor: Yes, you'll be asleep for the whole thing. 
Patient: Great, yes, I'd like to have this done, I can't keep living in this pain. 
Doctor: Awesome, I agree. Do you have control over your bladder and bowel movements? 
Patient: Yes, thankfully, I have complete control over everything like that still. 
Doctor: Do you wear a brace or corset normally?
Patient: Yes, I usually wear both.

Patient: Yes, doctor. Guess what, I just had my seventy seventh birthday. 
Doctor: Happy birthday!
Patient: Thank you, doctor. 
Doctor:  Just to confirm, ma'am, you identify as White, correct? 
Patient: Thank you. Yes, doctor. That's correct. 
Doctor: Okay, walk me through this. So, you've seen doctor X Y Z before, correct? 
Patient: Yes, that's right. I saw him for low back pain and lumbar scoliosis post laminectomy syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis, and symptomatic right L two radiculopathy.
Doctor: You were having right leg pain when you saw him? 
Patient: Yes. 
Doctor: Have you ever had surgery on your back? 
Patient: Yes, I had spinal stenosis, so they did, um, a laminectomy. 
Doctor: How did you respond to the procedure? 
Patient: Well, I had lower back pain and some arthritis in my spine after. 
Doctor: How have you been treated for these following the surgery? 
Patient: Um, Doctor X Y Z did some injections into my lower back. 
Doctor: Do you remember which side it was in?
Patient: It was in the right side, L2-L3.
Doctor: When was the last time you had these injections into the lower back?
Patient: The last one was in March of two thousand five. 
Doctor: How did your symptoms progress following the injections? 
Patient: Well, I went back to Doctor X Y Z, and then he thought that the symptoms I was having were coming from my right hip. 
Doctor: Did he do any imaging on this hip? 
Patient: Yes, I had some done when I saw him on, um, August fourth two thousand four. 
Doctor: Okay, the x rays we took today show marked degenerative changes, and a progression since the x rays taken back in August when you saw Doctor X Y Z. 
Patient: Oh no. Oh, he also did the injections into my right hip. 
Doctor: When was that?
Patient: Um, it was on April seventh two thousand five, and the last time I saw him was April fifteenth. 
Doctor: Is that when you had the last injections? 
Patient: Correct. 
Doctor: Has anyone talked to you about doing a hip replacement?
Patient: Yes, but right now I'm not sure if I want to do it. 
Doctor: Are you still having pain in that right hip today?
Patient: Yes, it still hurts. 
Doctor: What makes the pain worse? 
Patient: Well, anything that puts weight on this hip hurts really bad. 
Doctor: Okay, if it hurts that bad you should be using a cane. Did you ever get one?
Patient: Yes, I used one to come in here today, in fact. 
Doctor: Good. Do you have any other appointments scheduled?
Patient: Yeah, I made an appointment with an orthopedist in Newton. It's closer to my house. 
Doctor: That's fine. What medicines are you taking? 
Patient: Um, I take the generic for Ultracet. Sometimes I take as many as four times a day. 
Doctor: Does this help the pain?
Patient: No, I'm still in pretty significant pain, doctor.","Doctor: Good afternoon, sir. 
Patient: Good afternoon, doctor. 
Doctor: You're forty four, correct? 
Patient: Yes sir. 
Doctor: Great, what seems to be the problem today, sir? 
Patient: Well, doctor, I've had lower back pain for a while now. 
Doctor: Does the pain go into your legs? 
Patient: Yeah, I have pain in my right thigh too. 
Doctor: Is there an injury associated with this pain? 
Patient: Yes, I had an incident back in nineteen ninety four. 
Doctor: Do you have any paperwork or medical records from the initial injury? 
Patient: No sir, I don't have those today. 
Doctor: What do you do for a living, sir? 
Patient: Right now, I work at Taco Bell. I have a workers comp claim open.
Doctor: Your pain came back while working there, correct? 
Patient: Yes, that's correct. 
Doctor: Do you remember when your last appointment here was? 
Patient: Um, yes, it was on April twelfth two thousand five. 
Doctor: With ten being the worst pain imaginable, what was your pain out of ten at your last visit? 
Patient: Um, I'd say it was an eight out of ten. 
Doctor: Have you taken any medicine for this? 
Patient: Um, I had a Medrol Dosepak prescribed at my last visit. 
Doctor: How did your pain respond to the Dosepak? 
Patient: It took it down to about a four or five out of ten. 
Doctor: Can you point to me where the pain is, sir? 
Patient: Yes, it's right here. 
Doctor: This band right here? 
Patient: Yeah, that's the spot. 
Doctor: Okay, this is between your L four and sacrum. How would you describe your right leg pain?
Patient: I'd say it's intermittent and minimal now, it's not always there. 
Doctor: Have you ever had back surgery? 
Patient: Um, yes, I've had two laminectomies, one in nineteen ninety and the other was in ninety four. Wait, I also had a discectomy some time in between. 
Doctor: Do you know where the focus was?
Patient: It was at L four L 5. 
Doctor: Have you had any imaging done on the lower back? 
Patient: Yes, I had an M R I on October eighteenth two thousand four. I have the report right here. 
Doctor: Okay, this shows multi level degenerative changes, with facet involvement at L two L three, L three L four, and L five S1, with no neural impingement, which is good. 
Patient: What does that mean, doctor? 
Doctor: In summary, you have a significant amount of arthritis in the back. 
Patient: Oh yeah, I had an M R myelogram as well, here's the report. 
Doctor: Okay, this shows severe spinal stenosis at L three L four, but it may have been artifact. 
Patient: What does that mean? 
Doctor: This finding may be a misinterpretation.",GENHX,"The patient is a 44-year-old man who was seen for complaints of low back and right thigh pain.  He attributes this to an incident in which he was injured in 1994.  I do not have any paperwork authenticating his claim that there is an open claim.  Most recently he was working at Taco Bell, when he had a recurrence of back pain, and he was seen in our clinic on 04/12/05.  He rated pain of approximately 8/10 in severity. He took a Medrol Dosepak and states that his pain level has decreased to approximately 4-5/10.  He still localizes it to a band between L4 and the sacrum.  He initially had some right leg pain but states that this is minimal and intermittent at the present time.  His back history is significant for two laminectomies and a discectomy performed from 1990 to 1994.  The area of concern was L4-L5. The patient's MRI dated 10/18/04 showed multi-level degenerative changes, with facet involvement at L2-L3, L3-L4 and L5-S1.  There was no neural impingement.  He also had an MR myelogram, which showed severe stenosis at L3-L4, however it was qualified in that it may have been artifact, rather than a genuine finding.",0.94386935

Doctor: That does happen. Here, try this sample of Tarka, please. 
Patient: What is this for, doctor? 
Doctor: Well, since you're taking the Mavik plus verapamil, you can switch over to Tarka, which is the combined version of the two drugs. 
Patient: I can't take these, doctor. They're too big. 
Guest_family: Hello doctor, I'm her daughter. Just so you know, we check her blood pressure at home periodically and it's always similar to that reading. 
Doctor: Good, so back to that right arm, how is that doing today?
Patient: Well, that pain is basically gone now, I think it had to do with that muscle problem back in my right shoulder blade. 
Doctor: Did you have x rays taken today? 
Patient: Yes, the tech brought me back right before you came in. 
Doctor: Good, I have the images right here. 
Patient: What do they show, doctor?
Doctor: Well, these x rays of the neck and right shoulder show some degenerative changes, and possibly some kind of rotator cuff injury. 
Patient: What makes you think there's an injury? 
Doctor: Well, look right here. The humeral head is pretty high in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but do you have any pain here? 
Patient: No, none. 
Doctor: Then we won't worry about it. 
Patient: I am having this stomach pain though, doctor.
Doctor: How has this pain developed and progressed recently? 
Patient: Well, it's improved somewhat with me not taking Aleve anymore. 
Doctor: What medicines are you taking right now, then? 
Patient: Right know, I'm just taking Tylenol as needed. That seems to be enough for me.

Doctor: Do they come and go, the sores? 
Patient: Yes, one will come, then it'll heal up, then another.

Patient: And doctor, since I've been taking the Lexapro, I have some tremors on basically my whole body, at least the upper body, like my torso and arms.

Patient: Yes, we think so.",GENHX,"The patient is an 89-year-old lady.  She actually turns 90 later this month, seen today for a short-term followup.  Actually, the main reasons we are seeing her back so soon which are elevated blood pressure and her right arm symptoms are basically resolved.  Blood pressure is better even though she is not currently on the higher dose Mavik likely recommended.  She apparently did not feel well with the higher dose, so she just went back to her previous dose of 1 mg daily.  She thinks, she also has an element of office hypertension.  Also, since she is on Mavik plus verapamil, she could switch over to the combined drug Tarka.  However, when we gave her samples of that she thought they were too big for her to swallow.  Basically, she is just back on her previous blood pressure regimen.  However, her blood pressure seems to be better today.  Her daughter says that they do check it periodically and it is similar to today's reading.  Her right arm symptoms are basically resolved and she attributed that to her muscle problem back in the right shoulder blade.  We did do a C-spine and right shoulder x-ray and those just mainly showed some degenerative changes and possibly some rotator cuff injury with the humeral head quite high up in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but this does not seem to cause her any problems.  She has some vague 'stomach problems', although apparently it is improved when she stopped Aleve and she does not have any more aches or pains off Aleve.  She takes Tylenol p.r.n., which seems to be enough for her.  She does not think she has any acid reflux symptoms or heartburn.  She does take Tums t.i.d. and also Mylanta at night.  She has had dentures for many, many years and just recently I guess in the last few months, although she was somewhat vague on this, she has had some sores in her mouth.  They do heal up, but then she will get another one.  She also thinks since she has been on the Lexapro, she has somewhat of a tremor of her basically whole body at least upper body including the torso and arms and had all of the daughters who I not noticed to speak of and it is certainly difficult to tell her today that she has much tremor.

Patient: Yeah, it did. The pain after the incident got worse. I kind of feel it now more near my pinky area than my thumb area. 
Doctor: I see. So, near your ulnar side and not as much the radial side. You said earlier your wrist was already sore, right? Why was that? 
Patient: Remember how I told you about the time I had the worst pain of my life? That's how. I have some old notes you can see. Here you go. 
Doctor: Thank you. Oh, wow. It says here you have chronic scapholunate problems and other problems too. 
Patient: My scapho- what? 
Doctor: It's just some ligament damage in your wrist. I'll see what we can do to get your wrist feeling better.","Doctor: Good afternoon, dear, how old are you?
Patient: I'm fourteen years old. 
Doctor: Good, and what brings you in for a visit today? 
Patient: My left knee hurts really bad. 
Doctor: Oh no, how long has this knee been hurting you? 
Patient: Well, since the fall of two thousand seven. 
Doctor: Have you seen another doctor for this? 
Patient: Mom, can you tell the doctor?
Guest_family: Yes, actually, we went to another orthopedist in November of two thousand seven.
Doctor: I see, and what did this doctor recommend?
Guest_family: We got an MRI, I have a disc with the images, and the report as well right here, if you want to take a look at it. 
Doctor: Thank you, yes, so this shows left patellar chondromalacia. Has she been to P T?
Guest_family: We got a referral for P T, but they only wanted to do, um, let me look at my notes, patellar tracking exercises. 
Doctor: I see, has she been wearing her brace? 
Guest_family: Yes, she has been. I've been making sure of it. 
Doctor: That's good, and how is your pain today, dear? 
Patient: P T only made the pain much worse, it hurts so much.
Guest_family: Yes, she's in a lot of pain, is there anything else we can do, besides P T?
Doctor: Well, we're in a pretty difficult spot here. The majority of my patients get significantly better by just going to P T. 
Guest_family: Is there any surgery to fix this? 
Doctor: Usually, we manage this for six months without surgery, and she hasn't reached that milestone yet. But, because her pain is getting so severe, I can do a lateral capsular release on this knee. 
Guest_family: What is that?
Doctor: It's a small procedure, minimally invasive, and we can do it outpatient. Her kneecap is partially dislocating, so this surgery will get everything back into alignment. 
Guest_family: Okay, what is the risk of infection?
Doctor: The risk of infection is actually less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection.
Patient: Will I be asleep for this?
Doctor: Yes, you won't feel a thing. 
Patient: Will I need to go back to P T?
Doctor: Yes, you'll need to go some after the surgery to make sure everything heals up okay. The other risks include bleeding, changes in sensation and motion extremity, failure of procedure to relieve pain, need for postoperative rehab, and significant postoperative swelling.
Guest_family: I think we'd like to do the surgery. What do you think, honey?
Patient: Yeah, I think so too, I want to get back to playing soccer.

Doctor: Brachial plexopathy? 
Patient: Yes. That sounds right. 
Doctor: Oh, I see his notes in your chart. It says that he felt like you had a right superficial radial neuritis and blocked this with resolution of your symptoms. Then it looks like he sent you to get E M G testing at Valley Medical. Let me look for those results.

Patient: Yes, it goes down my, is this the femur? 
Doctor: Yes, that's the femur. 
Patient: Then this must be my tibia, it goes down the front of that too.

Patient: I feel popping and grinding, and my knee swells up.
Doctor: That numbness and tingling you feel in the thigh, do you feel that in the knee at all?
Patient: Actually yes, it feels like pins and needles there.
Doctor: What about this, when I touch the knee do you feel any abnormal discomfort or pain over the rest of the knee?
Patient: No, nothing out of the ordinary there. 
Doctor: What about this, this is the fibular head, which is where you feel the pins and needles. I'm applying pretty heavy pressure here, how would you describe what you're feeling?
Patient: Um, numbness, tingling, and then that same pins and needles feeling.  
Doctor: Is there any instability? 
Patient: Yes, and there's pain with it too.

Doctor: Any allergies I should know about? 
Patient: Yes, actually, I'm allergic to a lot of pain medications. 
Doctor: Okay, have there been any changes in how you're walking?
Patient: Yes, I had to change my walking pattern to take weight off my knee, and I think that has to do with my back pain.

The patient is seen with no outside images, but an MRI report of the left knee and office notes from Dr. ABCD. The patient reports that she has undergone a full course of physical therapy and complains primarily of pain in the anterior aspect of the left knee and primarily over the medial and lateral tibial components with pain extending proximally to the distal femur and distally down into the anterior tibial plateau area.  She has intermittent numbness and tingling in the posterolateral thigh and no symptoms at all into her feet.  She has axial low back pain as an ancillary symptom.  Her pain is worse with walking and is associated with swelling, popping and grinding.  She complains of pins and needles sensation over the area of the common peroneal nerve overlying the fibular head.  She has no dysesthetic or allodynic symptoms with light touch over the remainder of the knee and the femoral nerve area.  Heavy pressure and light percussion of the fibular head produce painful numbness, tingling, and pins and needles sensation.

Doctor: Great, so tell me, how long have you had this lower back pain? 
Patient: It's been about ten days now. 
Doctor: Have your symptoms improved at all since they began? 
Patient: No, they keep getting worse. 
Doctor: Does the pain radiate into your legs? 
Patient: Yes, it started radiating down my right leg three days after the lower back pain began, and then the left leg three days after the right. The next day I could barely walk, the pain was so severe. 
Doctor: Do you remember the initial date of the beginning of your low back pain? 
Patient: Um, it was on December third nineteen ninety five. 
Doctor: Have you seen another doctor for this pain? 
Patient: Yes, I saw my local physician, um, it was on December eleventh, but he wasn't able to pinpoint what was going on. 
Doctor: What kind of treatments did he recommend? 
Patient: He gave me some antiinflammatories and sent me on my way. 
Doctor: Did you drive yourself? 
Patient: Yes, I did. 
Doctor: How did the antiinflammatories work?

Doctor: Was there any leg numbness? 
Patient: Yes. Since December eleventh. 
Doctor:  Have you seen an orthopedist for this pain? 
Patient: Yes, I saw one the day after my primary care physician, but my legs gave out and I fell while walking to my car because of the leg weakness and back pain.

On 12/11/95, he drove himself to his local physician, but no diagnosis was rendered. He was given some NSAID and drove home. By the time he got home he had great difficulty walking due to LBP and weakness in BLE, but managed to feed his pets and himself.

Patient: I have a lot of frequency with urination, and I get up to pee at night at least two to three times.   Also, I have gained weight, I think about twelve pounds since March.  Right now, I am two eighty four pounds.
Doctor: Okay. So, I can see that your blood pressure is staying stable.  You do take Atenolol twelve point five M G per day and Lasix as needed. 
Patient: Yes, that's correct. It makes me pee so much. I do not take it.
Doctor: How about chest pain or shortness of breath?
Patient: No chest pain, but I am gradually feeling short of breath.
Doctor: What work you do?
Patient: I work for the city of Wichita as bus dispatcher. My work demands sitting a lot, and just really does not move around much.  But towards the end of the day my leg swells up.

In April of 2005, Dr. XYZ had asked Dr. XYZ to see her because of the persistent leukocytosis; however, Dr. XYZ felt that this was not a problem for the patient and asked her to just return here for follow up.  She also complains of a lot of frequency with urination and nocturia times two to three.  She has gained weight; she thinks about 12 pounds since March.  She now weighs 284.  Fortunately, her blood pressure is staying stable.  She takes atenolol 12.5 mg per day and takes Lasix on a p.r.n. basis, but does not like to take it because it causes her to urinate so much.

He initially saw Dr. Z and was provided with some muscle relaxer and was given some pain patches or Lidoderm patch, I believe.  The patient states that after this treatment, his symptoms still persisted.  At this point, the patient later on was referred to Dr. XYZ through the workmen's comp and he was initially evaluated back in April.  After the evaluation, the patient was sent for MRI, was provided with pain medications such as short-acting opioids.  He was put on restricted duty.  The MRI essentially came back negative, but the patient continued to have radiating symptoms down to his lower extremity and subsequently the patient was essentially released by Dr. XYZ in June with maximum medical improvement. Unfortunately, the patient continued to have persistence of back pain and radiating symptoms down to his leg and went back to see Dr. XYZ again, and at this point, the patient was provided with further medication management and sent for Pain Clinic referral.  The patient also was recommended for nerve block at this point and the patient received epidural steroid injection by Dr. ABC without any significant relief.  The patient also was sent for EMG and nerve conduction study, which was performed by Dr. ABCD and the MRI, EMG, and nerve conduction study came back essentially negative for radiculopathy, which was performed by Dr. ABCD.  The patient states that he continues to have pain with extended sitting, he has radiating symptoms down to his lower extremity on the right side of his leg, increase in pain with stooping. He has difficulty sleeping at nighttime because of increase in pain.  Ultimately, the patient was returned back to work in June, and deemed with maximum medical improvement back in June.  The patient unfortunately still has significant degree of back pain with activities such as stooping and radicular symptoms down his right leg, worse than the left side.  The patient also went to see Dr. X who is a chiropractic specialist and received eight or nine visits of chiropractic care without long-term relief in his overall radicular symptoms.",0.9416053

Patient: Which toes did I break? 
Doctor: You broke your second and fifth toes.

Patient: No, not today. 
Doctor:  Great, have you been going to P T? 
Patient: Yeah, I've been going about two or three times a week. 
Doctor: Are there any signs of infection, like drainage from the incision?
Patient: Nope, the wound healed up nicely. I'll be able to wear shorts again. 
Doctor: Great, are you having any fever symptoms, like cough, runny nose, sore throat, fatigue, anything like that? 
Patient: No, but I have had some tingling in both my feet. I don't know if its related to surgery. If I'm remembering the names right, um, I have a history of spinal stenosis and neuropathy in my legs.

Doctor: When you went for follow up, did you still have that pain down your legs? 
Patient: Yes, I did. 
Doctor: What did doctor X Y Z recommend at that time? 
Patient: He referred me to a Pain Clinic, and he recommended I have, um, epidural injections with doctor A B C. 
Doctor: Did you have this done? 
Patient: Yes, I did. 
Doctor: Did this help at all? 
Patient: No, it did absolutely nothing. 
Doctor: Okay, so after that, what treatment did you have?

The patient was approximately there for about two and a half weeks.  Date of injury occurred back in October.  The patient stating that he had history of previous back problems ongoing; however, he states that on this particular day back in October, he was unloading an 18-wheeler at ABC and he was bending down picking up boxes to unload and load.  Unfortunately at this particular event, the patient had sharp pain in his lower back.  Soon afterwards, he had radiating symptoms down his right buttock all the way down to the lateral part of his leg crossing his knee.  This became progressively worse.  He also states that some of his radiating pain went down to his left leg as well.  He noticed increase in buttock spasm and also noticed spasm in his buttocks.  He initially saw Dr. Z and was provided with some muscle relaxer and was given some pain patches or Lidoderm patch, I believe.  The patient states that after this treatment, his symptoms still persisted.  At this point, the patient later on was referred to Dr. XYZ through the workmen's comp and he was initially evaluated back in April.  After the evaluation, the patient was sent for MRI, was provided with pain medications such as short-acting opioids.  He was put on restricted duty.  The MRI essentially came back negative, but the patient continued to have radiating symptoms down to his lower extremity and subsequently the patient was essentially released by Dr. XYZ in June with maximum medical improvement. Unfortunately, the patient continued to have persistence of back pain and radiating symptoms down to his leg and went back to see Dr. XYZ again, and at this point, the patient was provided with further medication management and sent for Pain Clinic referral.  The patient also was recommended for nerve block at this point and the patient received epidural steroid injection by Dr. ABC without any significant relief.  The patient also was sent for EMG and nerve conduction study, which was performed by Dr. ABCD and the MRI, EMG, and nerve conduction study came back essentially negative for radiculopathy, which was performed by Dr. ABCD.  The patient states that he continues to have pain with extended sitting, he has radiating symptoms down to his lower extremity on the right side of his leg, increase in pain with stooping. He has difficulty sleeping at nighttime because of increase in pain.  Ultimately, the patient was returned back to work in June, and deemed with maximum medical improvement back in June.  The patient unfortunately still has significant degree of back pain with activities such as stooping and radicular symptoms down his right leg, worse than the left side.

Patient: Well, actually, my high blood pressure and right arm symptoms are basically gone. 
Doctor: Great, I saw your blood pressure reading for today, and it's much better. Are you taking the higher dose of Mavik we recommended? 
Patient: No, I'm not taking that right now. 
Doctor: How did you tolerate the higher dose? 
Patient: I didn't feel well at all, so I just went back to the old dose. 
Doctor: That was one M G per day, correct? 
Patient: Yes, doctor. I do think I could have some white coat high blood pressure. Doctors' offices make me nervous. 
Doctor: That does happen. Here, try this sample of Tarka, please. 
Patient: What is this for, doctor? 
Doctor: Well, since you're taking the Mavik plus verapamil, you can switch over to Tarka, which is the combined version of the two drugs. 
Patient: I can't take these, doctor. They're too big. 
Guest_family: Hello doctor, I'm her daughter. Just so you know, we check her blood pressure at home periodically and it's always similar to that reading. 
Doctor: Good, so back to that right arm, how is that doing today?
Patient: Well, that pain is basically gone now, I think it had to do with that muscle problem back in my right shoulder blade. 
Doctor: Did you have x rays taken today? 
Patient: Yes, the tech brought me back right before you came in. 
Doctor: Good, I have the images right here. 
Patient: What do they show, doctor?
Doctor: Well, these x rays of the neck and right shoulder show some degenerative changes, and possibly some kind of rotator cuff injury. 
Patient: What makes you think there's an injury? 
Doctor: Well, look right here. The humeral head is pretty high in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but do you have any pain here? 
Patient: No, none. 
Doctor: Then we won't worry about it. 
Patient: I am having this stomach pain though, doctor.
Doctor: How has this pain developed and progressed recently? 
Patient: Well, it's improved somewhat with me not taking Aleve anymore. 
Doctor: What medicines are you taking right now, then? 
Patient: Right know, I'm just taking Tylenol as needed. That seems to be enough for me. 
Doctor: Do you think this could be acid reflux, or heartburn?

Doctor: Do they come and go, the sores? 
Patient: Yes, one will come, then it'll heal up, then another.

Patient: And doctor, since I've been taking the Lexapro, I have some tremors on basically my whole body, at least the upper body, like my torso and arms.

Patient: Yes, we think so.",GENHX,"The patient is an 89-year-old lady.  She actually turns 90 later this month, seen today for a short-term followup.  Actually, the main reasons we are seeing her back so soon which are elevated blood pressure and her right arm symptoms are basically resolved.  Blood pressure is better even though she is not currently on the higher dose Mavik likely recommended.  She apparently did not feel well with the higher dose, so she just went back to her previous dose of 1 mg daily.  She thinks, she also has an element of office hypertension.  Also, since she is on Mavik plus verapamil, she could switch over to the combined drug Tarka.  However, when we gave her samples of that she thought they were too big for her to swallow.  Basically, she is just back on her previous blood pressure regimen.  However, her blood pressure seems to be better today.  Her daughter says that they do check it periodically and it is similar to today's reading.  Her right arm symptoms are basically resolved and she attributed that to her muscle problem back in the right shoulder blade.  We did do a C-spine and right shoulder x-ray and those just mainly showed some degenerative changes and possibly some rotator cuff injury with the humeral head quite high up in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but this does not seem to cause her any problems.  She has some vague 'stomach problems', although apparently it is improved when she stopped Aleve and she does not have any more aches or pains off Aleve.  She takes Tylenol p.r.n., which seems to be enough for her.  She does not think she has any acid reflux symptoms or heartburn.  She does take Tums t.i.d. and also Mylanta at night.  She has had dentures for many, many years and just recently I guess in the last few months, although she was somewhat vague on this, she has had some sores in her mouth.  They do heal up, but then she will get another one.  She also thinks since she has been on the Lexapro, she has somewhat of a tremor of her basically whole body at least upper body including the torso and arms and had all of the daughters who I not noticed to speak of and it is certainly difficult to tell her today that she has much tremor.

Doctor: I see, with ten being the worst pain of all time, how would you rate your pain today?
Patient: I'd say it's a six out of ten today. 
Doctor: What adjectives would you use to describe the pain?
Patient: Um, I'd say its shooting, sharp, and, um, aching.
Doctor: Specifically, what activities make the pain worse? 
Patient: Well, lifting, standing for a long time, or, um, squatting. I can't do that anymore.
Doctor: Does anything make the pain better?

Doctor: And no pain in your toes or lower legs?
Patient: No.
Doctor: Okay, did you try any medicines?
Patient: Yes, I did try some Tylenol but that's it. It does help a bit.

Patient: Yes.
Doctor: Okay. Overall, you do look better today and these medicines should take care of the pain. 
Patient: Thank you!
Doctor: Take care.","Doctor: Okay I am looking at you for multiple issues today. One of the biggest being swelling on your left leg. Can you tell me more about that?
Patient: Yes sure. I got this swelling for almost three years now, and it has been worse for the past two to three months. Sometimes it gets better in the morning when I get up, but then throughout the day it begins to swell again.  Lately it is staying bigger, and it feel uncomfortable with it being so large.  The right leg also swells, but not nearly like the left leg.
Doctor: How old are you, miss?
Patient: I am forty four. My biggest problem is this pain in my left shoulder. I feel as if this low back pain is due to a poor mattress. 
Doctor: Did you hurt your shoulder?
Patient: No, I don't remember hurting shoulder, but gradually I am losing some mobility.  It is hard for me to get my hands behind my back or behind my head.  I am losing strength in the left shoulder gradually for the last year.
Doctor: Ok let's look at your labs.
Patient: So far white counts are high. In April two thousand five Doctor X Y Z was asked to look at my high white count, but she thought it wasn't a problem and asked me to come for follow up.
Doctor: Any other complaints?
Patient: I have a lot of frequency with urination, and I get up to pee at night at least two to three times.   Also, I have gained weight, I think about twelve pounds since March.  Right now, I am two eighty four pounds.
Doctor: Okay. So, I can see that your blood pressure is staying stable.  You do take Atenolol twelve point five M G per day and Lasix as needed. 
Patient: Yes, that's correct. It makes me pee so much. I do not take it.
Doctor: How about chest pain or shortness of breath?
Patient: No chest pain, but I am gradually feeling short of breath.
Doctor: What work you do?
Patient: I work for the city of Wichita as bus dispatcher. My work demands sitting a lot, and just really does not move around much.  But towards the end of the day my leg swells up.
Doctor: Okay that's okay.
Patient: I need cholesterol check right?
Doctor: Yes, you do, but all the other labs are normal.",GENHX,"The patient is a 44-year-old white female who is here today with multiple problems.  The biggest concern she has today is her that left leg has been swollen.  It is swollen for three years to some extent, but worse for the past two to three months.  It gets better in the morning when she is up, but then through the day it begins to swell again.  Lately it is staying bigger and she somewhat uncomfortable with it being so large.  The right leg also swells, but not nearly like the left leg.  The other problem she had was she has had pain in her shoulder and back.  These occurred about a year ago, but the pain in her left shoulder is of most concern to her.  She feels like the low back pain is just a result of a poor mattress.  She does not remember hurting her shoulder, but she said gradually she has lost some mobility.  It is hard time to get her hands behind her back or behind her head.  She has lost strength in the left shoulder.  As far as the blood count goes, she had an elevated white count.  In April of 2005, Dr. XYZ had asked Dr. XYZ to see her because of the persistent leukocytosis; however, Dr. XYZ felt that this was not a problem for the patient and asked her to just return here for follow up.  She also complains of a lot of frequency with urination and nocturia times two to three.  She has gained weight; she thinks about 12 pounds since March.  She now weighs 284.  Fortunately, her blood pressure is staying stable.  She takes atenolol 12.5 mg per day and takes Lasix on a p.r.n. basis, but does not like to take it because it causes her to urinate so much.  She denies chest pain, but she does feel like she is becoming gradually more short of breath.  She works for the city of Wichita as bus dispatcher, so she does sit a lot, and just really does not move around much.  Towards the end of the day her leg was really swollen.  I reviewed her lab work.  Other than the blood count her lab work has been pretty normal, but she does need to have a cholesterol check.",0.9429471

Patient: I work from four to midnight, and then after getting home I just, I cannot sleep. It takes me around two hours and then I wake up at nine each morning. So, it's just like I'm not getting to sleep more than five to six hours ever. Usually, it is like five hours of sleep for me.

Doctor: Okay good. So, the neurological exam we did earlier, I have the results for it. 
Patient: And?
Doctor: Well, you were tested positive for Phalen's test on your left hand.
Patient: What does that means?
Doctor: It means that you have something called Carpal tunnel syndrome, which explains your numbness and tingling sensation in your left hand. It also explains your pain in the middle part of your hand as it's caused due to pinching or compression of a nerve called median nerve. 
Patient: Oh, how did that happen?
Doctor: Well, it's possible that your repetitive hand motion could have caused it or sometimes it's just the anatomy of your wrist. 
Patient: Oh, that explains my increased pain in the night after work. 
Doctor: Yeah.

Patient: Yes, that's right.","Patient: I think I need help. 
Doctor: I am here to help. Tell me what's going on.
Patient: I am having mood swings, sometimes I feel super happy and sometimes I am just super sad and angry with myself. I find myself in tears thinking about things or situations which are not even real. 
Doctor: How old are you ma'am?
Patient: I have just completed five decades of my life. 
Doctor: Did you ever try to hurt yourself?
Patient: No, that thought never came to my mind. I just feel sad, like nobody cares if I exist. Sometimes I feel I can conquer the world and do anything I put my heart and mind into. It's just that I am not sure how will I feel after an hour. 
Doctor: How long have you had these symptoms?
Patient: It has been going on for many months. At first, I ignored everything but now It feels like I am not myself any more with all these mood swings.
Doctor: Do you work?
Patient: Yes, I am a hygienist and work in a Bright Dentals.
Doctor: How are you doing at work with your mood swings?
Patient: Huh, my symptoms have sure started affecting my work. You know what the worst part is, my boss came to me last week and asked if I was on some kinds of drugs. I literally shouted at her saying no and left the clinic in tears. I think I need some drugs; I mean some medications to deal with my issues.
Doctor: Have you ever been on any kind of medicine or treatment before?
Patient: Yeah, I was on Wellbutrin before. It was prescribed by Doctor Jonah. I was eating a lot and even gained like twenty pounds in just a few months. My insurance didn't even cover it, I had to pay from my pocket. 
Doctor: Do you know what you were diagnosed with?
Patient: It is all in these papers, I got my file with me, I just want to be normal me again. 
Doctor: Let me check and enter it in the medical record for future references. According to this, they prescribed Wellbutrin for obsessive compulsive type disorder and yes it was related to your overeating. Did it help you?
Patient: Yes, I was doing better once I started taking that medicine regularly. I continued it even though I had to pay out of my pocket. 
Doctor: Have you ever been on antidepressants?
Patient: No.
Doctor: Any hot flashes or night sweat? Did you ever find yourself waking up to wet bed due to sweating?
Patient: No.
Doctor: Just putting together all that you have told me here. You have mood swings; you find yourself in tears without any specific reason, you are not suicidal, never been on any kind of antidepressants. Am I missing something here?
Patient: Sometimes I really find it hard to concentrate. As a hygienist I really need to focus on the gums of the patients and cleaning but sometimes it gets hard to focus. Normally, at work I just stop when it gets hard to focus and take a walk around the clinic. It has started affecting my work. I need help!
Doctor: Okay, I understand. Anything else that I should be aware of?
Patient: Oh yeah, the insomnia, I am hardly sleeping. At times I feel like a zombie. 
Doctor: Any surgeries in the past?
Patient: Yeah, I had some complications and they had to remove my complete uterus along with tubes and ovaries.
Doctor: Oh! When was this?
Patient: In the December of two thousand and three.",GENHX,"A 50-year-old female comes to the clinic with complaint of mood swings and tearfulness.  This has been problematic over the last several months and is just worsening to the point where it is impairing her work.  Her boss asks her if she was actually on drugs in which she said no.  She stated may be she needed to be, meaning taking some medications.  The patient had been prescribed Wellbutrin in the past and responded well to it; however, at that time it was prescribed for obsessive-compulsive type disorder relating to overeating and therefore her insurance would not cover the medication.  She has not been on any other antidepressants in the past.  She is not having any suicidal ideation but is having difficulty concentrating, rapid mood swings with tearfulness, and insomnia.  She denies any hot flashes or night sweats.  She underwent TAH with BSO in December of 2003.",0.9446609

Doctor: Sure. It's called Serotonin syndrome, ma'am. After careful evaluation of your labs, we found out that your white count and C P K was high, and those abnormalities lined up with serotonin syndrome. What are you experiencing right now?
Patient: I have been very restless and easily agitated, I have diarrhea. But no fever or shakiness.

Doctor: So, tell me are your hemorrhoids painful?
Patient: No, it's fine.
Doctor: And are you taking anything for constipation?

Doctor: Any headache or nerve pain or body pain?
Patient: Um, no I am fine.
Doctor: Any fall or imbalance problem?

Doctor: So, you have been seeking psychiatric help from Doctor Hudyncia right?
Patient: Yes.
Doctor: She mentioned in her report that you are responding well to her treatment and that your depression is under control and the medicine is working for you. That's good news. Oh, what medicine has she prescribed? Um let me see here in the report, oh okay, got it! It's Cymbalta. 
Patient: Right.
Doctor: And no side effects, right?
Patient: No.
Doctor: And looks like the plan is to treat you for a minimum one year. 
Patient: Yeah.
Doctor: Lastly, any breathing issues?

However, I also see one that is in the one teens and a couple in the 120s range. She is not bothered by cough or rib pain.  These are complaints, which I often hear about. Today, I reviewed Dr. Hudyncia's note from psychiatry.  Depression responded very well to Cymbalta, and the plan is to continue it probably for a minimum of 1 year.

Doctor: Is it the same when you are doing a lot of physical stuff like physical activities or something like that? 
Patient: Nope. Haven't noticed it with the exertion part. 
Doctor: Do you have any history of any heart issues in the past? 
Patient: I had the same kind of symptoms like nine or ten years ago.

Patient: The stream is good. It does feel like all is out in one go. I do not have any kind of bowel issues. I'm using my vaginal cream. Sometimes I feel difficulty in doing so because I feel that there is still something coming out from the vagina and I'm afraid that there might be a prolapse.

Patient: I'm twenty five years old. 
Doctor: Thank you. Doctor X, could you go over the diagnosis of erythema nodosum?
Doctor_2: She was diagnosed in two thousand and four after a biopsy was done that confirmed erythema nodosum, but the detail from the Netherlands is not that specific. 
Doctor: What kind of procedures were done to address it? 
Doctor_2: She had undergone a colonoscopy to address secondary diseases that may have been present because of the erythema nodosum, correct miss?
Patient: Yeah, that's correct. 
Doctor: Were there any findings, Doctor X? 
Doctor_2: The findings were uncertain if the terminal ileum had abnormal biopsies. However, the skin biopsy mentioned some fibrosis, basal proliferation, and inflammatory cells in the subcutis.
Doctor: I see. Her report states something about a tibia and fibula fracture on her right leg before the erythema nodosum. Are these skin lesions due to the fracture? 
Doctor_2: The skin lesions are not associated with the fracture, correct ma'am? 
Patient: That's correct. The cuts in my skins are on both legs too. Not just the right.
Doctor: Thank you. Did anything occur before the skin lesions? 
Doctor_2: She had cosmetic surgery done on her jaw. 
Doctor: Ma'am, I see you visited our clinic and the Dermatology several times, correct? 
Patient: Yeah, that's correct. I had a rash that I wanted to get checked. 
Doctor_2: I remember that. I was here when she presented the rash. We suggested the rash in her lower extremities and ankles was erythema nodosum. She also had discomfort, which could have been inflammatory arthritis. 
Doctor: Doctor X, did you confirm with any tests? 
Doctor_2: Yes. There was an initial S E D above one hundred and ten and her C P R was increased. 
Doctor: Great. In the visits after, were there any other problems found? 
Doctor_2: The reports says that no other abnormalities were found. However, I do see something about her first visit. 
Doctor: Could you explain what it says?
Doctor_2: She has some M T P detected, which could have been signs of erythema nodosum. However, the Dermatology did not agree, and they believed it to be venous stasis. 
Doctor: The venous stasis could have been related to the fracture, right? 
Doctor_2: That is correct. 
Doctor: Her initial visit reports suspicion of I B D, sarcoid inflammatory arthropathy, and lupus. Why was that? 
Doctor_2: She had a questionable rheumatoid fracture even though her C C P was negative. Her A N A was positive at one to four zero. There was a persistent speckled pattern. However, the rest of the lupus serologies were negative. 
Doctor: What lupus serologies were used? 
Doctor_2: Double stranded D N A, R N P, Smith, R O, and L A were used. 
Doctor: How did her cardiolipin antibodies panel look? 
Doctor_2: They were all negative. We made sure I g M, I g G, and I g A were less than ten. 
Doctor: I see. Was there anything else in the report? 
Doctor_2: She had her beta 2 glycoprotein one or R V V T tested. 
Doctor: That seems important because of the livedo pattern. 
Doctor_2: Exactly. That's why they concluded it was an onset of lupus and not rheumatoid arthritis because the arthritis couldn't be associated with erythema nodosum. 
Doctor: Why did she undergo a C T scan?
Doctor_2: We feared she had lymphoma. The scan of her chest, abdomen, and pelvis were done to rule out sarcoid. 
Doctor: I see. The results came out normal, right?
Doctor_2: That's correct. 
Doctor: Did you change some of you habits to help your bowels, ma'am? 
Patient: I tried my best to. 
Doctor: That's good. What was found Doctor X? 
Doctor_2: There was evidence of B twelve deficiency with a high methylmalonic and high homocystine levels along with a low normal B twelve in addition to iron studies consistent with iron deficiency and an initially low M C V.
Doctor: That gives the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease, right?
Doctor_2: Correct. That's stated in the report. 
Doctor: Were there any tests done to confirm this? 
Doctor_2: She underwent a colonoscopy, which showed nothing. Her endoscopy was also normal. Recently, she underwent a second coloscopy, and no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease was seen after viewing it microscopically. 
Doctor: Nothing was seen microscopically? 
Doctor_2: Actually, we determined there were aggregates of eosinophils. 
Doctor: That sounds important. That could be due to an allergic reaction or an emergence of Crohn Disease. I will have to discuss with Doctor Y from Gastroenterology to see the significance. 
Patient: Could I interrupt for a second? I don't think my B twelve and iron deficiency were looked at while I stayed in the United States. 
Doctor: Is that correct, Doctor X?
Doctor_2: That is. I think these details were from somewhere else. 
Doctor: At least we are aware of it. What medication was provided during her first visit? 
Doctor_2: It looks like she was placed on forty milligrams of prednisone. The strength was reduced over time. 
Doctor: This may be a reason to her acne. Was she taken off this medication?
Doctor_2: Yes, she was. There were too many adverse effects. 
Doctor: What was she places on after?
Doctor_2: It looks like she started a point six m g colchicine, which she took daily. 
Doctor: How were her inflammatory markers after taking it? 
Doctor_2: Her markers were under control and positive. She also didn't have any evidence of erythema nodosum. 
Doctor: That is great. How did you like that medication, ma'am? 
Patient: My ankle would swell up and hurt. There were also some sensitive rashes on the skin of my legs. 
Doctor: I see. Is that stated on the report, Doctor X? 
Doctor_2: It is. I also see that she was reevaluated by Dermatology. 
Doctor: Did they find anything apparent? 
Doctor_2: No, they didn't. They didn't find any evidence of erythema nodosum. 
Doctor: What was the plan following that? 
Docotr_2: It looks like we proceeded with a D E X A scan and checked her vitamin D levels. 
Doctor: Was there any medication prescribed? 
Doctor_2: We ordered vitamin D and calcium to be bought over the counter so that her bones were protected. However, they use of them was stopped until we figured out the underlying cause of her disease. 
Doctor: I see. Other than the fracture and jaw surgery, was there anything else? 
Doctor_2: It shows she had Varicella and Mononucleosis, correct ma'am? 
Patient: Yeah, that's correct. 
Doctor: That's good. Our recent physical exam with you from last August showed changes in your venous stasis and diffuse periarticular ankle edema. Fortunately, we did not find any erythema nodosum, but the livedo patter was still present. 
Patient: I see. Did you find anything else? 
Doctor: We did find a heart murmur, so we will conduct an echocardiogram. Doctor X, could you confirm all the details form the workup, please?
Doctor_2: Of course. Her A C E levels were normal. Her sed rate was around 30, which was high. Before that, it was around one ten, which is even higher. Her R V V T was normal. The rheumatoid factor was negative. The urinalysis was also normal. She had a C R P level of two point three, which was high. Her C C P came out negative. Her C B C displayed microcytosis and hypochromia with hematocrit levels of thirty seven point seven. Her hematocrit levels improved to forty point three later on, and she did not have any hypochromia, microcytosis, or anemia present. 
Doctor: Thank you for all that information. Does all this information and history seem to be correct, ma'am? 
Patient: Yes. Thank you for going over that in front of me. 
Doctor: No problem. I see you're here today regarding some mild but intense skin rashes. You mentioned that you thought it was erythema nodosum, correct? 
Patient: Yeah, that's correct. I think it's on my ankles. I also feel some joint stiffness. 
Doctor: I will take note of that. You also mentioned something about a rash before. Did you have a rash that was sensitive to U V light, like sunlight? 
Patient: That's right. I had it twice when I was in Europe. 
Doctor: When did you notice the rashes? 
Patient: I was skiing, and my face started to swell up. 
Doctor: I see. Do you think it had to do anything with your acne? 
Patient: No. My acne was stable after I stopped taking that one medicine and started the other. 
Doctor: The prednisone and colchicine we mentioned earlier, correct? 
Patient: That's correct. 
Doctor: Is there anything else you would like to ask? 
Patient: I am trying to get pregnant and would like to know if the medication has any effects on pregnancy. 
Doctor: I'll discus that with you right now. 
Patient: Actually, could you provide me with a pamphlet? I need to go study for my psychology classes. I have a big test tomorrow.",GENHX,"This is a 25-year-old woman who is attending psychology classes.  She was diagnosed with presumptive erythema nodosum in 2004 based on a biopsy consistent with erythema nodosum, but not entirely specific back in Netherlands.  At that point, she had undergone workup which was extensive for secondary diseases associated with erythema nodosum.  Part of her workup included a colonoscopy.  The findings were equivocal characterizes not clearly abnormal biopsies of the terminal ileum. The skin biopsy, in particular, mentions some fibrosis, basal proliferation, and inflammatory cells in the subcutis. Prior to the onset of her erythema nodosum, she had a tibia-fibula fracture several years before on the right, which was not temporarily associated with the skin lesions, which are present in both legs anyway.  Even, a jaw cosmetic surgery she underwent was long before she started developing her skin lesions.  She was seen in our clinic and by Dermatology on several occasions.  Apart from the first couple of visits when she presented stating a recurrent skin rash with a description suggestive of erythema nodosum in the lower extremities and ankle and there is discomfort pointing towards a possible inflammatory arthritis and an initial high sed rate of above 110 with an increased CRP.  In the following visits, no evident abnormality has been detected.  In the first visit, here some MTP discomfort detected.  It was thought that erythema nodosum may be present.  However, the evaluation of Dermatology did not concur and it was thought that the patient had venous stasis, which could be related to her prior fracture.  When she was initially seen here, a suspicion of IBD, sarcoid inflammatory arthropathy, and lupus was raised.  She had an equivocal rheumatoid fracture, but her CCP was negative.  She had an ANA, which was positive at 1:40 with a speckled pattern persistently, but the rest of the lupus serologies including double-stranded DNA, RNP, Smith, Ro, La were negative.  Her cardiolipin panel antibodies were negative as well.  We followed the IgM, IgG, and IgA being less than 10.  However, she did have a beta-2 glycoprotein 1 or an RVVT tested and this may be important since she has a livedo pattern.  It was thought that the onset of lupus may be the case.  It was thought that rheumatoid arthritis could not be the case since it is not associated with erythema nodosum.  For the fear of possible lymphoma, she underwent CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  It was done also in order to rule out sarcoid and the result was unremarkable.  Based on some changes in her bowel habits and evidence of B12 deficiency with a high methylmalonic and high homocystine levels along with a low normal B12 in addition to iron studies consistent with iron deficiency and an initially low MCV, the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease was employed.  The patient underwent an initially unrevealing colonoscopy and a capsule endoscopy, which was normal.  A second colonoscopy was done recently and microscopically no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease was seen.  However, eosinophil aggregations were noted in microscopy and this was told to be consistent with an allergic reaction or an emerging Crohn disease and I will need to discuss with Gastroenterology what is the significance of that.  Her possible B12 deficiency and iron deficiency were never addressed during her stay here in the United States. In the initial appointment, she was placed on prednisone 40 mg, which was gradually titrated down this led to an exacerbation of her acne.  We decided to take her off prednisone due to adverse effects and start her on colchicine 0.6 mg daily.  While this kept things under control with the inflammatory markers being positive and no overt episodes of erythema nodosum, the patient still complains for sensitivity with less suspicious skin rash in the lower extremities and occasional ankle swelling and pain.  She was reevaluated by Dermatology for that and no evidence of erythema nodosum was felt to be present.  Out plan was to proceed with a DEXA scan, at some point check a vitamin D level, and order vitamin D and calcium over the counter for bone protection purposes.  However, the later was deferred until we have resolved the situation and find out what is the underlying cause of her disease. Her past medical history apart from the tibia-fibular fracture and the jaw cosmetic surgery is significant for varicella and mononucleosis. Her physical examination had shown consistently diffuse periarticular ankle edema and also venous stasis changes at least until I took over her care last August.  I have not been able to detect any erythema nodosum, however, a livedo pattern has been detected consistently.  She also has evidence of acne, which does not seem to be present at the moment.  She also was found to have a heart murmur present and we are going to proceed with an echocardiogram placed. Her workup during the initial appointment included an ACE level, which was normal.  She also had a rather higher sed rate up to 30, but prior to that, per report, it was even higher, above 110.  Her RVVT was normal, her rheumatoid factor was negative.  Her ANA was 1:40, speckled pattern.  The double-stranded DNA was negative.  Her RNP and Smith were negative as well.  RO and LA were negative and cardiolipin antibodies were negative as well.  A urinalysis at the moment was completely normal.  A CRP was 2.3 in the initial appointment, which was high.  A CCP was negative.  Her CBC had shown microcytosis and hypochromia with a hematocrit of 37.7.  This improved later without any evidence of hypochromia, microcytosis or anemia with a hematocrit of 40.3. The patient returns here today, as I mentioned, complaining of milder bouts of skin rash, which she calls erythema nodosum, which is accompanied by arthralgias, especially in the ankles.  I am mentioning here that photosensitivity rash was mentioned in the past.  She tells me that she had it twice back in Europe after skiing where her whole face was swollen.  Her acne has been very stable after she was taken off prednisone and was started on colchicine 0.6 daily.  Today we discussed about the effect of colchicine on a possible pregnancy.",0.91556597

Doctor: Yes we can. But we'll probably need to do another procedure until his foot matures some more.   This is a stabilizing measure.
Guest_family: What are the risks of infection if we do the surgery? 
Doctor: Historically, the risk of infection is very low, usually less than one percent. 
Guest_family: How do you get the risk so low? 
Doctor: We use prophylactic antibiotics to minimize the infection risk. 
Guest_family: Will he be able to walk again right after the surgery? 
Doctor: No, he'll need to stay off it for a while, we call this nonweightbearing. It will only be for some time after the procedure, it's not permanent.  
Guest_family: What are the rest of the risks?
Doctor: The total risks of surgery include risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for other surgical procedures, need to be nonweightbearing for some time. I would not worry about these risks, though. The risk is low.

Doctor: Oh certainly, yes, it is. What treatments have you had for this knee, aside from surgery? 
Patient: I've done a full course of PT for this. 
Doctor: Where is your knee pain? 
Patient: Mostly, it's here in the front of the knee, and then on both sides, like the inside and outside.
Doctor: Does the pain go down your leg at all? 
Patient: Yes, it goes down my, is this the femur? 
Doctor: Yes, that's the femur. 
Patient: Then this must be my tibia, it goes down the front of that too. 
Doctor: Does it go into your thigh at all?
Patient: Yes, it goes into the back of my thigh. I feel numbness and tingling back there. 
Doctor: Do you feel anything in the feet?
Patient: Nope, my feet are completely normal, thankfully.
Doctor: Are you having any back pain? 
Patient: A little, I feel something in my lower back, I'm not sure if it's related.
Doctor: Does anything make your knee pain worse? 
Patient: Yeah, I can hardly walk anymore, it hurts so bad. 
Doctor: What kind of symptoms do you see when you walk on this?
Patient: I feel popping and grinding, and my knee swells up.
Doctor: That numbness and tingling you feel in the thigh, do you feel that in the knee at all?
Patient: Actually yes, it feels like pins and needles there.
Doctor: What about this, when I touch the knee do you feel any abnormal discomfort or pain over the rest of the knee?
Patient: No, nothing out of the ordinary there. 
Doctor: What about this, this is the fibular head, which is where you feel the pins and needles. I'm applying pretty heavy pressure here, how would you describe what you're feeling?
Patient: Um, numbness, tingling, and then that same pins and needles feeling.  
Doctor: Is there any instability? 
Patient: Yes, and there's pain with it too. 
Doctor: Are you working right now?
Patient: No, I'm not right now. 
Doctor: Any allergies I should know about? 
Patient: Yes, actually, I'm allergic to a lot of pain medications. 
Doctor: Okay, have there been any changes in how you're walking?
Patient: Yes, I had to change my walking pattern to take weight off my knee, and I think that has to do with my back pain. 
Doctor: That's certainly a possibility. How would you describe your pain? 
Patient: I'd say its constant, shooting, cramping, aching, throbbing, feels like it's being pulled, sharp, and , um, stabbing. All of those words seem fitting. 
Doctor: Okay, does the pain wake you up at night? 
Patient: Yeah, it does occasionally. 
Doctor: Does anything make this feel better?
Patient: Yeah, it gets a little better if I lay down or if I keep my leg elevated. 
Doctor: Out of ten, with ten being the worst pain ever, how would you describe your pain on average? 
Patient: Um, I'd say six out of ten. That's how it is right now, too. 
Doctor: What about at its worst?
Patient: Easily, its ten out of ten. 
Doctor: Finally, what about when the pain is at its least?
Patient: Um, when it's not too bad, I'd say it's a three out of ten. I also have this other M R I report from September of O six, here.

On her date of injury, she reports that she was working on an aircraft when she fell between the airplane and a stand with about an 18-inch gap in between.  She injured her left knee and underwent two arthroscopic procedures followed by patellar replacement and subsequently a left total knee arthroplasty in Month DD, YYYY. The patient is seen with no outside images, but an MRI report of the left knee and office notes from Dr. ABCD. The patient reports that she has undergone a full course of physical therapy and complains primarily of pain in the anterior aspect of the left knee and primarily over the medial and lateral tibial components with pain extending proximally to the distal femur and distally down into the anterior tibial plateau area.  She has intermittent numbness and tingling in the posterolateral thigh and no symptoms at all into her feet.  She has axial low back pain as an ancillary symptom.  Her pain is worse with walking and is associated with swelling, popping and grinding.  She complains of pins and needles sensation over the area of the common peroneal nerve overlying the fibular head.  She has no dysesthetic or allodynic symptoms with light touch over the remainder of the knee and the femoral nerve area.  Heavy pressure and light percussion of the fibular head produce painful numbness, tingling, and pins and needles sensation. The patient underwent a left knee MRI in September of 2006 revealing nonspecific edema anterior to the patellar tendon, but no evidence of an acute fracture or a femoropatellar ligament avulsion or abnormality.  She has continued to complain of persistent instability and pain.  She is not working.  She has a number of allergies to different pain medications and feels that her back has been bothersome mostly due to her gait disturbances relating to her knee.  Her pain is described as constant, shooting, cramping, aching, throbbing, pulling, sharp, and stabbing in nature.  It occasionally awakens her at night.  It is better in recumbency with her leg elevated.   Exacerbating factors include standing, walking, pushing, puling.

Doctor: Did these relieve the pain at all? 
Patient: Well, it was only a temporary relief. Is there anything else we can do?
Doctor: Well, there is surgery for this.
Patient: What are the risks of infection from the surgery?
Doctor: Historically, it's less than one percent. 
Patient: How is this possible? 
Doctor: We use prophylactic antibiotics in order to eliminate the risk.
Patient: That's great, I've heard of D V T from the commercials, is there a risk for that?

Patient: P T only made the pain much worse, it hurts so much.
Guest_family: Yes, she's in a lot of pain, is there anything else we can do, besides P T?
Doctor: Well, we're in a pretty difficult spot here. The majority of my patients get significantly better by just going to P T. 
Guest_family: Is there any surgery to fix this? 
Doctor: Usually, we manage this for six months without surgery, and she hasn't reached that milestone yet. But, because her pain is getting so severe, I can do a lateral capsular release on this knee. 
Guest_family: What is that?
Doctor: It's a small procedure, minimally invasive, and we can do it outpatient. Her kneecap is partially dislocating, so this surgery will get everything back into alignment. 
Guest_family: Okay, what is the risk of infection?
Doctor: The risk of infection is actually less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection.
Patient: Will I be asleep for this?
Doctor: Yes, you won't feel a thing. 
Patient: Will I need to go back to P T?
Doctor: Yes, you'll need to go some after the surgery to make sure everything heals up okay. The other risks include bleeding, changes in sensation and motion extremity, failure of procedure to relieve pain, need for postoperative rehab, and significant postoperative swelling.
Guest_family: I think we'd like to do the surgery. What do you think, honey?

Patient: Yes. 
Doctor:  Has your pain been present for the eight years, or did it come and go? 
Patient: It's been persistent, and I've had difficulties on and off since then. 
Doctor: Okay. The x rays from Doctor A B C show severe degenerative changes as well as avascular necrosis of the femoral head. What else did the Doctor do for you? 
Patient: He gave me some pain medicine, and we talked about going to another specialist for surgery.
Doctor: Do you remember the names of the procedures suggested? 
Patient: Something about resurfacing the hip, or a hip replacement. I'm here for another opinion on that. 
Doctor: I saw you come in with a cane, do you have groin pain as well?    
Patient: Yes, and I can't do any of the activities I used to.

Patient: He gave me some pain medicine, and we talked about going to another specialist for surgery.
Doctor: Do you remember the names of the procedures suggested? 
Patient: Something about resurfacing the hip, or a hip replacement. I'm here for another opinion on that.

Patient: Yes, and I can't do any of the activities I used to.

Doctor: Hello. How old is he?
Guest_family: He is eighty years old. He is suffering from dementia. 
Doctor: I see. Do you think he will be able to provide me with his medical history?
Guest_family: I don't think so. Sometimes he even forgets his name. 
Patient: He's kidding. I know my name. I also know his kids' names. I do agree that sometimes I forget my things or feel lost. 
Doctor: I don't blame you. I forget my things at my age.
Guest_family: Yeah, it is something like episodic that he forgets everything and sometimes he's absolutely normal. On good days, he's very nice to talk to. 
Doctor: What is his living status?
Guest_family: He lives at a board and care. It is a cozier homelike place.  
Doctor: That's good. So what brings you here in the emergency today?
Guest_family: He started complaining of stomach aches. Luckily, I was there. It was very sudden at one moment he was talking to me nicely and then all of a sudden he started complaining of severe pain in his stomach area. That's when I decided to bring him here in the emergency room. 
Doctor: Do you have any previous reports? 
Patient: I have these reports. 
Doctor: Do you remember when was this scan done? 
Patient: I have no idea. I just had these reports with me. 
Doctor: Do you remember of any medical issues before? 
Patient: Huh uh. 
Doctor: Okay, let me see what your scan says. I am reading the C T Scan report provided by the patient. It states that patient has dilated bladder with thick wall suggesting an outlet obstruction as well as bilateral hydronephrosis and hydroureter.
Patient: Hm. 
Doctor: I see that you have already been given some I V fluid along with antibiotics by the emergency room doctor. 
Guest_family: Yeah. 
Doctor: Did he ever complain of pain during urination or nausea and vomiting?
Guest_family: Yes, he had fever a few days back. When we asked him about other symptoms, he said, it's hard to urinate and it is painful. Nausea and vomiting are something that I am not sure about. He was normally rushing to the restroom and every time used to say he didn't want to pee as it hurt him. He also had a few accidents in the last few days where he wet himself.

It will be very helpful for me to treat him now.",GENHX,"The patient is a pleasant but demented 80-year-old male, who lives in board and care, who presented with acute onset of abdominal pain.

Doctor: What was that for? 
Patient: I had an abscess in my left glute, so I had a surgery to remove and clean it out. 
Doctor: How is the abscess today? 
Patient: It's getting better, I follow up with the surgeon today after this appointment. 
Doctor: Good, what about your medical history?
Patient: I have high blood pressure and high triglyceride levels. 
Doctor: Okay, thank you. What about newly diagnosed conditions?   
Patient: Well, I got diagnosed with diabetes too. 
Doctor: What symptoms have you been experiencing with your diabetes? 
Patient: Well, I've been peeing a lot, and I've been really thirsty, too. 
Doctor: How have you been treated for this to date? 
Patient: Um, I saw the endocrinologists while I was in the hospital, and they gave me insulin. 
Doctor: Are you still taking the insulin? 
Patient: No, I can't afford to pay for it. So, they gave me Glucophage and, um, glyburide. 
Doctor: Have you been taking these? 
Patient: Yes, exactly as instructed. 
Doctor: Good, and how do you feel today? 
Patient: Overall, I'd say I'm feeling better.","Doctor: Hi, how are you doing today? 
Patient: I've been better. Thank you. 
Doctor: So, you are here for your follow up right? Remind me how often are you coming here? 
Patient: That's right. I'm coming around between a month or two. 
Doctor: Yeah, it's every four to eight weeks. 
Patient: I'm not taking any medicine now. I just wanted to let you know. 
Doctor: Yeah, I can see it in your record. It says that you are off of all the immunosuppression. So, just let me check. It says here that you do have mild chronic G V H D. It is not that bad that I should be worried about any therapy or anything else. How long ago did you get that transplant? 
Patient: I think it was around four and a half years ago. I'm feeling much better after that. I do have complaints of blood in my stool. But after you sent me to that doctor, that gastro doctor, I feel good. I know they said that they removed something, but I'm not sure, but after that it has been improved a lot. 
Doctor: Okay, let me see in my chart. You had some rectal bleeding issues because of which I referred you to the gastroenterologist. A complete endoscopy was performed, which was both on the upper and the lower side. There was no evidence of ulcers or any other abnormality. That's  good news, right? 
Patient: Yeah, I agree. That was a relief. 
Doctor: They did find some polyps and they removed it. They turned out to be benign, so nothing to worry about there. 
Patient: Yeah, I remember this said they removed something, but I forgot the name. 
Doctor: Is there any other issue that I can help you with? 
Patient: I don't know. I feel a lot of fatigue and like I'm not able to do things like I used to do before. I get tired very easily. I don't know if it is related to something or not, but things have been weird. I'm not able to do even the minor things like I lift two boxes and I'm done for the day. Is it something that I should be worried about? 
Doctor: It looks like you have a mild iron deficiency. I will work on that with you, don't worry.",GENHX,"The patient comes to the clinic today for followup.  I am seeing him once every 4 to 8 weeks.  He is off of all immunosuppression.  He does have mild chronic GVHD but not enough to warrant any therapy and the disease has been under control and he is 4-1/2-years posttransplant. He has multiple complaints.  He has had hematochezia.  I referred him to gastroenterology.  They did an upper and lower endoscopy.  No evidence of ulcers or any abnormality was found.  Some polyps were removed.  They were benign.  He may have mild iron deficiency, but he is fatigued and has several complaints related to his level of activity.",0.93736595

Blood pressure is better even though she is not currently on the higher dose Mavik likely recommended.  She apparently did not feel well with the higher dose, so she just went back to her previous dose of 1 mg daily.  She thinks, she also has an element of office hypertension.

Basically, she is just back on her previous blood pressure regimen.  However, her blood pressure seems to be better today.

Basically the patient states that yesterday she fell and she is not certain about the circumstances, on her driveway, and on her left side hit a rock.  When she came to the emergency room, she was found to have a rapid atrial tachyarrhythmia, and was put on Cardizem with reportedly heart rate in the 50s, so that was stopped.

Patient: I was referred by a doctor to come see you so that you could check up on my nasal problems. Here is my report from my previous doctor who referred me to you. 
Doctor: Thank you. Let me take a look.  I see here it says you had severe sinusitis two to three months ago, correct? 
Patient:  Is that what they're calling my nasal problems? 
Doctor: Yeah, it is. Sinusitis is the inflammation of your nasal airways. 
Patient: I see. Thank you for describing it to me. 
Doctor: No problem. Would you be able to describe to me what you had been feeling two to three months ago? 
Patient: Yeah, I can. My face would feel uncomfortable, my nose was stuffy, my eyes hurt, and I felt something dropping in the back of my throat.
Doctor: Have you ever been prescribed any medication? 
Patient: Here's the list of medicine I was taking. 
Doctor: I see you were given antibiotics, correct? 
Patient: I was, but I don't know what those are. Could you explain them to me? 
Doctor: Antibiotics are usually used to fight infections. 
Patient: I had an infection? I thought I just had some nasal problems. 
Doctor: Your report states you had a severe infection. Do you remember if the antibiotics helped? 
Patient: Not really. I felt like my symptoms were the same. 
Doctor: I see. Did your doctor order any advanced imaging's? 
Patient: Yeah. They did a C T scan of my nose. Here is the report from my C T scan. 
Doctor: Let me take a look. It looks like you had some thickening of the mucosal layer in your right paranasal sinus. You also had some obstruction in your right ostiomeatal complex and excess growing of some of the bones in your nose. Uhm. Oh, one more thing. I see your nasal septum was shifted to the left. 
Patient: Oh, wow. Thank you for explaining everything to me. 
Doctor: No problem. Going back to your list of medications, I know you took antibiotics for your infection, but did you take any medication for your sinuses? 
Patient: No, I haven't. I did try this cream for my nose, but that didn't work either. Nothing worked! 
Doctor: I see. Looks like the cream you used was a topical nasal corticosteroid. Are there any other symptoms that you have been experiencing? 
Patient: I've had some trouble with my balance, and I feel like I've lost some of my hearing. I thought this was odd since I'm only fifty years old. I think my ears felt plugged or full of air, so they just needed to pop. 
Doctor: I see. Let's perform an audiogram test to check your ears. 
Patient: Sounds good. 
Doctor: I'm seeing that you have some mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Your tympanometry seems to be normal. Your speech discrimination was also normal. 
Patient: That's reassuring. 
Doctor: I want to ask a few more questions about your ears. Do you feel any fullness or pressure?  
Patient: No, I don't feel anything like that right now. 
Doctor: Do you hear any humming, buzzing, or roaring sounds?
Patient: Nope. I don't hear anything like that. 
Doctor: We checked your ears and now understand more about the problem, but I wonder why your balance is affected. When did you start noticing your balance was affected? 
Patient: I think it could have been to this one medicine that starts with an A. I forgot the name, but it didn't really help my nasal problems. It just made my balance worse. 
Doctor: Was the medicine called Allegra? 
Patient: Oh, yeah. That's what it was called. I thought I had some sort of allergy, so I thought it would help. 
Doctor: I see. Did you ever feel any dizziness too? 
Patient: Yeah, I did. 
Doctor: I will have you do some movements to see if your dizziness occurs. 
Patient: Sounds good. 
Doctor: Could you look to the left and then look to the right. 
Patient: Oh, wow. That made me very dizzy. 
Doctor: Looks like sudden movements and head turning make your dizziness worse.",GENHX,"I had the pleasure of meeting and evaluating the patient referred today for evaluation and treatment of chronic sinusitis.  As you are well aware, she is a pleasant 50-year-old female who states she started having severe sinusitis about two to three months ago with facial discomfort, nasal congestion, eye pain, and postnasal drip symptoms.  She states she really has sinus problems, but this infection has been rather severe and she notes she has not had much improvement with antibiotics.  She had a CT of her paranasal sinuses identifying mild mucosal thickening of right paranasal sinuses with occlusion of the ostiomeatal complex on the right and turbinate hypertrophy was also noted when I reviewed the films and there is some minimal nasal septum deviation to the left.  She currently is not taking any medication for her sinuses.  She also has noted that she is having some problems with her balance and possible hearing loss or at least ear popping and fullness.  Her audiogram today demonstrated mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss, normal tympanometry, and normal speech discrimination.  She has tried topical nasal corticosteroid therapy without much improvement.  She tried Allegra without much improvement and she believes the Allegra may have caused problems with balance to worsen.  She notes her dizziness to be much worse if she does quick positional changes such as head turning or sudden movements, no ear fullness, pressure, humming, buzzing or roaring noted in her ears.

Doctor: Well, these x rays of the neck and right shoulder show some degenerative changes, and possibly some kind of rotator cuff injury. 
Patient: What makes you think there's an injury? 
Doctor: Well, look right here. The humeral head is pretty high in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but do you have any pain here? 
Patient: No, none. 
Doctor: Then we won't worry about it. 
Patient: I am having this stomach pain though, doctor.
Doctor: How has this pain developed and progressed recently? 
Patient: Well, it's improved somewhat with me not taking Aleve anymore. 
Doctor: What medicines are you taking right now, then? 
Patient: Right know, I'm just taking Tylenol as needed. That seems to be enough for me. 
Doctor: Do you think this could be acid reflux, or heartburn?
Patient: No, but I take Tums, um, three times a day, and Mylanta at night. Oh yeah, I have these sores in my mouth, can you take a look? 
Doctor: I see. How long have you worn dentures? 
Patient: Oh I couldn't even tell you, it's been many, many years. 
Doctor: Do they come and go, the sores? 
Patient: Yes, one will come, then it'll heal up, then another. 
Doctor: Okay, we'll keep an eye on it. 
Patient: And doctor, since I've been taking the Lexapro, I have some tremors on basically my whole body, at least the upper body, like my torso and arms. 
Doctor: It's hard to tell if you have a tremor today, ma'am, but do you think the Lexapro is helping otherwise? 
Patient: Yes, we think so.",GENHX,"The patient is an 89-year-old lady.  She actually turns 90 later this month, seen today for a short-term followup.  Actually, the main reasons we are seeing her back so soon which are elevated blood pressure and her right arm symptoms are basically resolved.  Blood pressure is better even though she is not currently on the higher dose Mavik likely recommended.  She apparently did not feel well with the higher dose, so she just went back to her previous dose of 1 mg daily.  She thinks, she also has an element of office hypertension.  Also, since she is on Mavik plus verapamil, she could switch over to the combined drug Tarka.  However, when we gave her samples of that she thought they were too big for her to swallow.  Basically, she is just back on her previous blood pressure regimen.  However, her blood pressure seems to be better today.  Her daughter says that they do check it periodically and it is similar to today's reading.  Her right arm symptoms are basically resolved and she attributed that to her muscle problem back in the right shoulder blade.  We did do a C-spine and right shoulder x-ray and those just mainly showed some degenerative changes and possibly some rotator cuff injury with the humeral head quite high up in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but this does not seem to cause her any problems.  She has some vague 'stomach problems', although apparently it is improved when she stopped Aleve and she does not have any more aches or pains off Aleve.  She takes Tylenol p.r.n., which seems to be enough for her.  She does not think she has any acid reflux symptoms or heartburn.  She does take Tums t.i.d. and also Mylanta at night.  She has had dentures for many, many years and just recently I guess in the last few months, although she was somewhat vague on this, she has had some sores in her mouth.  They do heal up, but then she will get another one.  She also thinks since she has been on the Lexapro, she has somewhat of a tremor of her basically whole body at least upper body including the torso and arms and had all of the daughters who I not noticed to speak of and it is certainly difficult to tell her today that she has much tremor.  They do think the Lexapro has helped to some extent.",0.9252401
