He works in the flint and it is really hot where he works and it has been quite humid lately.  The third problem is that he has a wart or a spot that he thinks is a wart on the right middle finger.  He is interested in getting that frozen today.  Apparently, he tells me I froze a previous wart on him in the past and it went away.  Next, he is interested in getting some blood test done.  He specifically mentions the blood test for his prostate, which I informed him is called the PSA.  He is 50 years old now.  He will also be getting his cholesterol checked again because he has a history of high cholesterol.  He made a big difference in his cholesterol by quitting smoking, but unfortunately after taking his social history today he tells me that he is back to smoking.  He says it is difficult to quit.

Patient: I was referred by a doctor to come see you so that you could check up on my nasal problems. Here is my report from my previous doctor who referred me to you. 
Doctor: Thank you. Let me take a look.  I see here it says you had severe sinusitis two to three months ago, correct? 
Patient:  Is that what they're calling my nasal problems? 
Doctor: Yeah, it is. Sinusitis is the inflammation of your nasal airways. 
Patient: I see. Thank you for describing it to me. 
Doctor: No problem. Would you be able to describe to me what you had been feeling two to three months ago? 
Patient: Yeah, I can. My face would feel uncomfortable, my nose was stuffy, my eyes hurt, and I felt something dropping in the back of my throat.
Doctor: Have you ever been prescribed any medication? 
Patient: Here's the list of medicine I was taking. 
Doctor: I see you were given antibiotics, correct? 
Patient: I was, but I don't know what those are. Could you explain them to me? 
Doctor: Antibiotics are usually used to fight infections. 
Patient: I had an infection? I thought I just had some nasal problems. 
Doctor: Your report states you had a severe infection. Do you remember if the antibiotics helped? 
Patient: Not really. I felt like my symptoms were the same. 
Doctor: I see. Did your doctor order any advanced imaging's? 
Patient: Yeah. They did a C T scan of my nose. Here is the report from my C T scan. 
Doctor: Let me take a look. It looks like you had some thickening of the mucosal layer in your right paranasal sinus. You also had some obstruction in your right ostiomeatal complex and excess growing of some of the bones in your nose. Uhm. Oh, one more thing. I see your nasal septum was shifted to the left. 
Patient: Oh, wow. Thank you for explaining everything to me. 
Doctor: No problem. Going back to your list of medications, I know you took antibiotics for your infection, but did you take any medication for your sinuses? 
Patient: No, I haven't. I did try this cream for my nose, but that didn't work either. Nothing worked! 
Doctor: I see. Looks like the cream you used was a topical nasal corticosteroid. Are there any other symptoms that you have been experiencing? 
Patient: I've had some trouble with my balance, and I feel like I've lost some of my hearing. I thought this was odd since I'm only fifty years old. I think my ears felt plugged or full of air, so they just needed to pop. 
Doctor: I see. Let's perform an audiogram test to check your ears. 
Patient: Sounds good. 
Doctor: I'm seeing that you have some mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Your tympanometry seems to be normal. Your speech discrimination was also normal. 
Patient: That's reassuring. 
Doctor: I want to ask a few more questions about your ears. Do you feel any fullness or pressure?  
Patient: No, I don't feel anything like that right now. 
Doctor: Do you hear any humming, buzzing, or roaring sounds?
Patient: Nope. I don't hear anything like that. 
Doctor: We checked your ears and now understand more about the problem, but I wonder why your balance is affected. When did you start noticing your balance was affected? 
Patient: I think it could have been to this one medicine that starts with an A. I forgot the name, but it didn't really help my nasal problems. It just made my balance worse. 
Doctor: Was the medicine called Allegra? 
Patient: Oh, yeah. That's what it was called. I thought I had some sort of allergy, so I thought it would help. 
Doctor: I see. Did you ever feel any dizziness too? 
Patient: Yeah, I did. 
Doctor: I will have you do some movements to see if your dizziness occurs. 
Patient: Sounds good. 
Doctor: Could you look to the left and then look to the right. 
Patient: Oh, wow. That made me very dizzy. 
Doctor: Looks like sudden movements and head turning make your dizziness worse.",GENHX,"I had the pleasure of meeting and evaluating the patient referred today for evaluation and treatment of chronic sinusitis.  As you are well aware, she is a pleasant 50-year-old female who states she started having severe sinusitis about two to three months ago with facial discomfort, nasal congestion, eye pain, and postnasal drip symptoms.  She states she really has sinus problems, but this infection has been rather severe and she notes she has not had much improvement with antibiotics.  She had a CT of her paranasal sinuses identifying mild mucosal thickening of right paranasal sinuses with occlusion of the ostiomeatal complex on the right and turbinate hypertrophy was also noted when I reviewed the films and there is some minimal nasal septum deviation to the left.  She currently is not taking any medication for her sinuses.  She also has noted that she is having some problems with her balance and possible hearing loss or at least ear popping and fullness.  Her audiogram today demonstrated mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss, normal tympanometry, and normal speech discrimination.  She has tried topical nasal corticosteroid therapy without much improvement.  She tried Allegra without much improvement and she believes the Allegra may have caused problems with balance to worsen.  She notes her dizziness to be much worse if she does quick positional changes such as head turning or sudden movements, no ear fullness, pressure, humming, buzzing or roaring noted in her ears.

Doctor: Oh no, how long has this knee been hurting you? 
Patient: Well, since the fall of two thousand seven. 
Doctor: Have you seen another doctor for this? 
Patient: Mom, can you tell the doctor?
Guest_family: Yes, actually, we went to another orthopedist in November of two thousand seven.
Doctor: I see, and what did this doctor recommend?
Guest_family: We got an MRI, I have a disc with the images, and the report as well right here, if you want to take a look at it. 
Doctor: Thank you, yes, so this shows left patellar chondromalacia. Has she been to P T?
Guest_family: We got a referral for P T, but they only wanted to do, um, let me look at my notes, patellar tracking exercises. 
Doctor: I see, has she been wearing her brace? 
Guest_family: Yes, she has been. I've been making sure of it. 
Doctor: That's good, and how is your pain today, dear? 
Patient: P T only made the pain much worse, it hurts so much.
Guest_family: Yes, she's in a lot of pain, is there anything else we can do, besides P T?
Doctor: Well, we're in a pretty difficult spot here. The majority of my patients get significantly better by just going to P T. 
Guest_family: Is there any surgery to fix this? 
Doctor: Usually, we manage this for six months without surgery, and she hasn't reached that milestone yet. But, because her pain is getting so severe, I can do a lateral capsular release on this knee. 
Guest_family: What is that?
Doctor: It's a small procedure, minimally invasive, and we can do it outpatient. Her kneecap is partially dislocating, so this surgery will get everything back into alignment. 
Guest_family: Okay, what is the risk of infection?
Doctor: The risk of infection is actually less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection.
Patient: Will I be asleep for this?
Doctor: Yes, you won't feel a thing. 
Patient: Will I need to go back to P T?
Doctor: Yes, you'll need to go some after the surgery to make sure everything heals up okay. The other risks include bleeding, changes in sensation and motion extremity, failure of procedure to relieve pain, need for postoperative rehab, and significant postoperative swelling.
Guest_family: I think we'd like to do the surgery. What do you think, honey?
Patient: Yeah, I think so too, I want to get back to playing soccer.

Patient: I was referred by a doctor to come see you so that you could check up on my nasal problems. Here is my report from my previous doctor who referred me to you. 
Doctor: Thank you. Let me take a look.  I see here it says you had severe sinusitis two to three months ago, correct? 
Patient:  Is that what they're calling my nasal problems? 
Doctor: Yeah, it is. Sinusitis is the inflammation of your nasal airways.

Doctor: No problem. Would you be able to describe to me what you had been feeling two to three months ago?

Patient: Here's the list of medicine I was taking. 
Doctor: I see you were given antibiotics, correct? 
Patient: I was, but I don't know what those are. Could you explain them to me? 
Doctor: Antibiotics are usually used to fight infections. 
Patient: I had an infection? I thought I just had some nasal problems. 
Doctor: Your report states you had a severe infection. Do you remember if the antibiotics helped? 
Patient: Not really. I felt like my symptoms were the same. 
Doctor: I see. Did your doctor order any advanced imaging's? 
Patient: Yeah. They did a C T scan of my nose. Here is the report from my C T scan. 
Doctor: Let me take a look. It looks like you had some thickening of the mucosal layer in your right paranasal sinus. You also had some obstruction in your right ostiomeatal complex and excess growing of some of the bones in your nose. Uhm. Oh, one more thing. I see your nasal septum was shifted to the left. 
Patient: Oh, wow. Thank you for explaining everything to me. 
Doctor: No problem. Going back to your list of medications, I know you took antibiotics for your infection, but did you take any medication for your sinuses? 
Patient: No, I haven't. I did try this cream for my nose, but that didn't work either. Nothing worked! 
Doctor: I see. Looks like the cream you used was a topical nasal corticosteroid. Are there any other symptoms that you have been experiencing? 
Patient: I've had some trouble with my balance, and I feel like I've lost some of my hearing. I thought this was odd since I'm only fifty years old. I think my ears felt plugged or full of air, so they just needed to pop. 
Doctor: I see. Let's perform an audiogram test to check your ears. 
Patient: Sounds good. 
Doctor: I'm seeing that you have some mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Your tympanometry seems to be normal. Your speech discrimination was also normal. 
Patient: That's reassuring. 
Doctor: I want to ask a few more questions about your ears. Do you feel any fullness or pressure?  
Patient: No, I don't feel anything like that right now. 
Doctor: Do you hear any humming, buzzing, or roaring sounds?
Patient: Nope. I don't hear anything like that. 
Doctor: We checked your ears and now understand more about the problem, but I wonder why your balance is affected. When did you start noticing your balance was affected? 
Patient: I think it could have been to this one medicine that starts with an A. I forgot the name, but it didn't really help my nasal problems. It just made my balance worse. 
Doctor: Was the medicine called Allegra? 
Patient: Oh, yeah. That's what it was called. I thought I had some sort of allergy, so I thought it would help. 
Doctor: I see. Did you ever feel any dizziness too? 
Patient: Yeah, I did. 
Doctor: I will have you do some movements to see if your dizziness occurs. 
Patient: Sounds good. 
Doctor: Could you look to the left and then look to the right.

Patient: Um, it was on April seventh two thousand five, and the last time I saw him was April fifteenth. 
Doctor: Is that when you had the last injections? 
Patient: Correct. 
Doctor: Has anyone talked to you about doing a hip replacement?
Patient: Yes, but right now I'm not sure if I want to do it. 
Doctor: Are you still having pain in that right hip today?
Patient: Yes, it still hurts. 
Doctor: What makes the pain worse? 
Patient: Well, anything that puts weight on this hip hurts really bad. 
Doctor: Okay, if it hurts that bad you should be using a cane. Did you ever get one?
Patient: Yes, I used one to come in here today, in fact. 
Doctor: Good. Do you have any other appointments scheduled?
Patient: Yeah, I made an appointment with an orthopedist in Newton. It's closer to my house. 
Doctor: That's fine. What medicines are you taking?

Patient: Sounds good to me. 
Doctor_2: Hi, ma'am. Could you confirm your age for me, please? 
Patient: I'm seventy six years old. I'm also a resident of A S D F if that matters. 
Doctor_2: Thank you, ma'am. 
Doctor: Doctor A B  C requested for you to see us, correct? 
Patient: That's correct. 
Doctor: Perfect. Doctor X, could you go over her previous diagnoses? 
Doctor_2: She is diagnosed with hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease. Is this all correct, ma'am? 
Patient: Sounds about right. 
Doctor: I see she underwent a procedure. What was it, Doctor X? 
Doctor_2: She underwent a decompression for L three and L four. Did Doctor Stanley Gertzbein perform this procedure for your back? 
Patient: He did. He also did surgery on my lower legs.
Doctor_2: Thank you for confirming. 
Doctor: I see after the surgery, you had some pain in your right L four distribution, correct? 
Patient: That's correct. 
Doctor: Doctor X, did the M R I report of the outside lumbar come in? 
Doctor_2: It did. We also have a report of a lumbar C T myelogram, but no films came. 
Doctor: What does the C T myelogram say? 
Doctor_2: It says she has spondylolisthesis and L four and L 5 stenosis with right posterior surgical fusion changes at both levels. 
Doctor: I see. There are some notes from Doctor Reitman. What does it say? 
Doctor_2: It looks like she is being sent for an L four selective nerve root block to rule out if she would be a candidate for a T L I F at L four and L 5. 
Doctor: I see. Could you review the M R I film as well? 
Doctor_2: The M R I reveal a grade two L four anterior spondylolisthesis without major canal stenosis. She does, however, have facet joint disease at this level and dorsal postoperative changes. She also has a foraminal disc protrusion on the right and a severely degenerated disc at L three and L four. 
Doctor: Thank you for that. So, miss. Where are you feeling pain today? 
Patient: I feel it in the font of my lower leg and right hip. 
Doctor: What kind of pain are you feeling?
Patient: I told Doctor X about it. He could let you know. 
Doctor_2: She claimed she had a burning, shooting, aching, and constant pain in nature. 
Doctor: I see. Is it worse when you do certain activities? 
Patient: Yes. When I walk and stand. 
Doctor: Are you able to walk at all? 
Patient: I can walk around a block before it gets to the point where I get weak. 
Doctor: When does it feel better? 
Patient: I feel more comfortable when I'm resting, sitting, sleeping, or getting a massage. 
Doctor: From a scale of zero to ten, with ten being the worst pain, how would you rate the pain on average? 
Patient: I'd say like a nine. 
Doctor: That's the intensity on a daily level, correct? 
Patient: Yeah, that's correct. 
Doctor: What's the lowest pain you've ever felt? 
Patient: I think it was a five. 
Doctor: I see. Doctor X, did you ask her the series of questions about bowel function? 
Doctor_2: I did. She denied any bowel or bladder dysfunction, saddle area hypoesthesia, numbness, tingling, weakness or Valsalva related exacerbation.
Doctor: Great. Have you taken any medication recently? 
Patient: Uh. I think it starts with a T. 
Doctor_2: It states here you took Tylenol, correct?

Guest_family: Is there any surgery to fix this? 
Doctor: Usually, we manage this for six months without surgery, and she hasn't reached that milestone yet. But, because her pain is getting so severe, I can do a lateral capsular release on this knee. 
Guest_family: What is that?
Doctor: It's a small procedure, minimally invasive, and we can do it outpatient. Her kneecap is partially dislocating, so this surgery will get everything back into alignment. 
Guest_family: Okay, what is the risk of infection?
Doctor: The risk of infection is actually less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection.
Patient: Will I be asleep for this?
Doctor: Yes, you won't feel a thing. 
Patient: Will I need to go back to P T?
Doctor: Yes, you'll need to go some after the surgery to make sure everything heals up okay. The other risks include bleeding, changes in sensation and motion extremity, failure of procedure to relieve pain, need for postoperative rehab, and significant postoperative swelling.

Most recently he was working at Taco Bell, when he had a recurrence of back pain, and he was seen in our clinic on 04/12/05.  He rated pain of approximately 8/10 in severity. He took a Medrol Dosepak and states that his pain level has decreased to approximately 4-5/10.  He still localizes it to a band between L4 and the sacrum.  He initially had some right leg pain but states that this is minimal and intermittent at the present time.  His back history is significant for two laminectomies and a discectomy performed from 1990 to 1994.  The area of concern was L4-L5. The patient's MRI dated 10/18/04 showed multi-level degenerative changes, with facet involvement at L2-L3, L3-L4 and L5-S1.  There was no neural impingement.  He also had an MR myelogram, which showed severe stenosis at L3-L4, however it was qualified in that it may have been artifact, rather than a genuine finding.",0.94574904

Unfortunately at this particular event, the patient had sharp pain in his lower back.  Soon afterwards, he had radiating symptoms down his right buttock all the way down to the lateral part of his leg crossing his knee.  This became progressively worse.

The patient states that after this treatment, his symptoms still persisted.  At this point, the patient later on was referred to Dr. XYZ through the workmen's comp and he was initially evaluated back in April.  After the evaluation, the patient was sent for MRI, was provided with pain medications such as short-acting opioids.  He was put on restricted duty.  The MRI essentially came back negative, but the patient continued to have radiating symptoms down to his lower extremity and subsequently the patient was essentially released by Dr. XYZ in June with maximum medical improvement. Unfortunately, the patient continued to have persistence of back pain and radiating symptoms down to his leg and went back to see Dr. XYZ again, and at this point, the patient was provided with further medication management and sent for Pain Clinic referral.  The patient also was recommended for nerve block at this point and the patient received epidural steroid injection by Dr. ABC without any significant relief.

Doctor: That does happen. Here, try this sample of Tarka, please. 
Patient: What is this for, doctor? 
Doctor: Well, since you're taking the Mavik plus verapamil, you can switch over to Tarka, which is the combined version of the two drugs.

Guest_family: Hello doctor, I'm her daughter. Just so you know, we check her blood pressure at home periodically and it's always similar to that reading. 
Doctor: Good, so back to that right arm, how is that doing today?
Patient: Well, that pain is basically gone now, I think it had to do with that muscle problem back in my right shoulder blade. 
Doctor: Did you have x rays taken today? 
Patient: Yes, the tech brought me back right before you came in. 
Doctor: Good, I have the images right here. 
Patient: What do they show, doctor?
Doctor: Well, these x rays of the neck and right shoulder show some degenerative changes, and possibly some kind of rotator cuff injury. 
Patient: What makes you think there's an injury? 
Doctor: Well, look right here. The humeral head is pretty high in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but do you have any pain here? 
Patient: No, none.

Patient: I am having this stomach pain though, doctor.
Doctor: How has this pain developed and progressed recently? 
Patient: Well, it's improved somewhat with me not taking Aleve anymore. 
Doctor: What medicines are you taking right now, then? 
Patient: Right know, I'm just taking Tylenol as needed. That seems to be enough for me.

Patient: Yes, we think so.",GENHX,"The patient is an 89-year-old lady.  She actually turns 90 later this month, seen today for a short-term followup.  Actually, the main reasons we are seeing her back so soon which are elevated blood pressure and her right arm symptoms are basically resolved.  Blood pressure is better even though she is not currently on the higher dose Mavik likely recommended.  She apparently did not feel well with the higher dose, so she just went back to her previous dose of 1 mg daily.  She thinks, she also has an element of office hypertension.  Also, since she is on Mavik plus verapamil, she could switch over to the combined drug Tarka.  However, when we gave her samples of that she thought they were too big for her to swallow.  Basically, she is just back on her previous blood pressure regimen.  However, her blood pressure seems to be better today.  Her daughter says that they do check it periodically and it is similar to today's reading.  Her right arm symptoms are basically resolved and she attributed that to her muscle problem back in the right shoulder blade.  We did do a C-spine and right shoulder x-ray and those just mainly showed some degenerative changes and possibly some rotator cuff injury with the humeral head quite high up in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but this does not seem to cause her any problems.  She has some vague 'stomach problems', although apparently it is improved when she stopped Aleve and she does not have any more aches or pains off Aleve.  She takes Tylenol p.r.n., which seems to be enough for her.  She does not think she has any acid reflux symptoms or heartburn.  She does take Tums t.i.d. and also Mylanta at night.  She has had dentures for many, many years and just recently I guess in the last few months, although she was somewhat vague on this, she has had some sores in her mouth.  They do heal up, but then she will get another one.  She also thinks since she has been on the Lexapro, she has somewhat of a tremor of her basically whole body at least upper body including the torso and arms and had all of the daughters who I not noticed to speak of and it is certainly difficult to tell her today that she has much tremor.

Doctor: Yes, it is much better than any of your previous visits. And no side effects, right?
Patient: No.

Doctor: And you mention it is kind of radiating from your lower back.
Patient: Yeah, kind of like from my spine maybe, I am not sure.
Doctor: And no pain in your toes or lower legs?
Patient: No.
Doctor: Okay, did you try any medicines?
Patient: Yes, I did try some Tylenol but that's it. It does help a bit.
Doctor: Okay, let's try something stronger, I will write you a prescription for it. You can take it for a week and if your pain does not improve, we will take some x rays.
Doctor: How old are you again eighty-five? 
Patient: Yes.
Doctor: Okay. Overall, you do look better today and these medicines should take care of the pain.

Doctor: Also, I need you to remind me, when was your lower back surgery?
Patient: It was in January of two thousand five. What was the name of the surgery, again?
Doctor: It was a lumbar disc replacement. So, how are you feeling today? 
Patient: Truthfully doctor, the surgery did nothing. I'm still in a lot of pain. 
Doctor: Besides the surgery, what other interventions have you tried?
Patient: I have them written down, let me look. Um, I did acupuncture, T E N S unit at P T, and I've been to the chiropractor too. 
Doctor: Have you taken any medicines? 
Patient: Yeah, I have those written down here. I've taken Elavil, Topamax, Cymbalta, Neurontin, and Lexapro.
Doctor: Are you still taking any of these? 
Patient: No, I had bad side effects to some, and the others just didn't do anything. 
Doctor: Have you had any injections for this pain?
Patient: I've had a few into the, um, piriformis. 
Doctor: Did that do anything?
Patient: Um, it provided some brief relief, I guess. I had a Botox procedure done on March eighth two thousand six. 
Doctor: How did this work? 
Patient: Honestly, it did nothing. 
Doctor: Where is your pain, exactly?
Patient: I'd say its seventy five percent in my butt and leg, and twenty five percent in my lower back. 
Doctor: Are you able to workout, or exercise, anything like that? 
Patient: I've tried to increase how much I walk, but when I do I get spasms in my lower back. 
Doctor: I see, with ten being the worst pain of all time, how would you rate your pain today?
Patient: I'd say it's a six out of ten today. 
Doctor: What adjectives would you use to describe the pain?
Patient: Um, I'd say its shooting, sharp, and, um, aching.
Doctor: Specifically, what activities make the pain worse? 
Patient: Well, lifting, standing for a long time, or, um, squatting. I can't do that anymore.
Doctor: Does anything make the pain better? 
Patient: Um, sitting back, ice, and I guess there's some improvement with the pain medication. 
Doctor: Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
Patient: It's constant now, but, um, the intensity of it comes and goes. 
Doctor: Are you able to sleep at night?
Patient: Not really, it is affecting my sleep, which in turn affects my mood. 
Doctor: So, overall, I can summarize and say you're not happy with your pain relief so far?

I'm still having a fear of feeling of pressure in the backside of my head and it comes approximately like once each week. 
Doctor: What exactly does this pressure feels like? 
Patient: It feels like pins and needles in my head and a lot of pressure and often it feels like water is running down my hair. 
Doctor: How frequent are these feelings? Is anything helping you? Are you taking any medications or anything else for it? 
Patient: It is like I said before, like once a week maybe. It has decreased from before. I am taking Aleve and it is kind of helping me.

Doctor: Do you work?
Patient: Yes, I am a hygienist and work in a Bright Dentals.
Doctor: How are you doing at work with your mood swings?
Patient: Huh, my symptoms have sure started affecting my work. You know what the worst part is, my boss came to me last week and asked if I was on some kinds of drugs. I literally shouted at her saying no and left the clinic in tears. I think I need some drugs; I mean some medications to deal with my issues.
Doctor: Have you ever been on any kind of medicine or treatment before?
Patient: Yeah, I was on Wellbutrin before. It was prescribed by Doctor Jonah. I was eating a lot and even gained like twenty pounds in just a few months. My insurance didn't even cover it, I had to pay from my pocket. 
Doctor: Do you know what you were diagnosed with?
Patient: It is all in these papers, I got my file with me, I just want to be normal me again. 
Doctor: Let me check and enter it in the medical record for future references. According to this, they prescribed Wellbutrin for obsessive compulsive type disorder and yes it was related to your overeating. Did it help you?
Patient: Yes, I was doing better once I started taking that medicine regularly. I continued it even though I had to pay out of my pocket. 
Doctor: Have you ever been on antidepressants?
Patient: No.
Doctor: Any hot flashes or night sweat? Did you ever find yourself waking up to wet bed due to sweating?
Patient: No.
Doctor: Just putting together all that you have told me here. You have mood swings; you find yourself in tears without any specific reason, you are not suicidal, never been on any kind of antidepressants. Am I missing something here?
Patient: Sometimes I really find it hard to concentrate. As a hygienist I really need to focus on the gums of the patients and cleaning but sometimes it gets hard to focus. Normally, at work I just stop when it gets hard to focus and take a walk around the clinic. It has started affecting my work. I need help!

Patient: It is mostly in my middle finger, but sometimes I also get this on the first or the second finger of my right hand. Sometimes I have pain in my thumb as well. Do you think it is arthritis?

Doctor: It's less than one percent. We use prophylactic antibiotics to control for infection the entire time.

Doctor: Well, you were tested positive for Phalen's test on your left hand.
Patient: What does that means?
Doctor: It means that you have something called Carpal tunnel syndrome, which explains your numbness and tingling sensation in your left hand. It also explains your pain in the middle part of your hand as it's caused due to pinching or compression of a nerve called median nerve. 
Patient: Oh, how did that happen?
Doctor: Well, it's possible that your repetitive hand motion could have caused it or sometimes it's just the anatomy of your wrist.

Doctor: Sure. It's called Serotonin syndrome, ma'am. After careful evaluation of your labs, we found out that your white count and C P K was high, and those abnormalities lined up with serotonin syndrome. What are you experiencing right now?
Patient: I have been very restless and easily agitated, I have diarrhea. But no fever or shakiness.
Doctor: These can match serotonin syndrome as well. You deny any fever, tremor or hypperflexia so we will give you some IV fluids and I will check on you in an hour or so.

Doctor: What about this, when I touch the knee do you feel any abnormal discomfort or pain over the rest of the knee?
Patient: No, nothing out of the ordinary there.

The patient reports that she has undergone a full course of physical therapy and complains primarily of pain in the anterior aspect of the left knee and primarily over the medial and lateral tibial components with pain extending proximally to the distal femur and distally down into the anterior tibial plateau area.  She has intermittent numbness and tingling in the posterolateral thigh and no symptoms at all into her feet.  She has axial low back pain as an ancillary symptom.  Her pain is worse with walking and is associated with swelling, popping and grinding.  She complains of pins and needles sensation over the area of the common peroneal nerve overlying the fibular head.  She has no dysesthetic or allodynic symptoms with light touch over the remainder of the knee and the femoral nerve area.  Heavy pressure and light percussion of the fibular head produce painful numbness, tingling, and pins and needles sensation.

She has continued to complain of persistent instability and pain.  She is not working.  She has a number of allergies to different pain medications and feels that her back has been bothersome mostly due to her gait disturbances relating to her knee.  Her pain is described as constant, shooting, cramping, aching, throbbing, pulling, sharp, and stabbing in nature.  It occasionally awakens her at night.  It is better in recumbency with her leg elevated.   Exacerbating factors include standing, walking, pushing, puling.

Patient: I've been better. Thank you. 
Doctor: So, you are here for your follow up right? Remind me how often are you coming here? 
Patient: That's right. I'm coming around between a month or two. 
Doctor: Yeah, it's every four to eight weeks. 
Patient: I'm not taking any medicine now. I just wanted to let you know. 
Doctor: Yeah, I can see it in your record. It says that you are off of all the immunosuppression. So, just let me check. It says here that you do have mild chronic G V H D. It is not that bad that I should be worried about any therapy or anything else. How long ago did you get that transplant? 
Patient: I think it was around four and a half years ago. I'm feeling much better after that. I do have complaints of blood in my stool. But after you sent me to that doctor, that gastro doctor, I feel good. I know they said that they removed something, but I'm not sure, but after that it has been improved a lot. 
Doctor: Okay, let me see in my chart. You had some rectal bleeding issues because of which I referred you to the gastroenterologist. A complete endoscopy was performed, which was both on the upper and the lower side. There was no evidence of ulcers or any other abnormality. That's  good news, right? 
Patient: Yeah, I agree. That was a relief. 
Doctor: They did find some polyps and they removed it. They turned out to be benign, so nothing to worry about there. 
Patient: Yeah, I remember this said they removed something, but I forgot the name. 
Doctor: Is there any other issue that I can help you with? 
Patient: I don't know. I feel a lot of fatigue and like I'm not able to do things like I used to do before. I get tired very easily. I don't know if it is related to something or not, but things have been weird. I'm not able to do even the minor things like I lift two boxes and I'm done for the day. Is it something that I should be worried about?

Doctor: Ha ha. So, it says here they they want me to check you for atrial fibrillation. Yet another fancy word to add to your list. 
Patient: What does it mean?
Doctor: It means I must check if you have faster than normal heartbeat after your fall. In simple words, just to check if there are any irregularities in your heart beating, okay?

Doctor: What happened in the emergency room?
Patient: They gave me some medicine. And they put something on my finger. They said that my heart rate was very high. 
Doctor: Yeah, in the record it says that they found rapid atrial tachyarrhythmia. So, according to this, they have given you Cardizem and they stopped it when your heart rate came to fifties.
Doctor: Let me review your electrocardiogram from emergency. It says that there was rapid heart rate. Your heart was really beating very fast and then there was one more electrocardiogram which showed that your pacemaker is acting weird. 
Patient: They also did the same test this morning. 
Doctor: One they did this morning shows normal rate with frequent early heartbeats. Looks like they also tested your blood. Your potassium level is three point one. 
Doctor: How was your heart feeling when you fell yesterday?
Patient: I felt that I just ran in a race. I could feel all the pain after that fall. It was ugly. My heart was pounding so fast it was ready to come out, I never felt like that before in my life. 
Doctor: Did you feel the same way afterwards as well?
Patient: No, it was just after fall. It did not stay like that for long, I was normal later. I never felt it again after that incident.

Basically the patient states that yesterday she fell and she is not certain about the circumstances, on her driveway, and on her left side hit a rock.  When she came to the emergency room, she was found to have a rapid atrial tachyarrhythmia, and was put on Cardizem with reportedly heart rate in the 50s, so that was stopped.

Doctor: Thank you. Let me take a look.  I see here it says you had severe sinusitis two to three months ago, correct?

Doctor: Have you ever been prescribed any medication? 
Patient: Here's the list of medicine I was taking. 
Doctor: I see you were given antibiotics, correct? 
Patient: I was, but I don't know what those are. Could you explain them to me? 
Doctor: Antibiotics are usually used to fight infections. 
Patient: I had an infection? I thought I just had some nasal problems. 
Doctor: Your report states you had a severe infection. Do you remember if the antibiotics helped? 
Patient: Not really. I felt like my symptoms were the same. 
Doctor: I see. Did your doctor order any advanced imaging's? 
Patient: Yeah. They did a C T scan of my nose. Here is the report from my C T scan. 
Doctor: Let me take a look. It looks like you had some thickening of the mucosal layer in your right paranasal sinus. You also had some obstruction in your right ostiomeatal complex and excess growing of some of the bones in your nose. Uhm. Oh, one more thing. I see your nasal septum was shifted to the left. 
Patient: Oh, wow. Thank you for explaining everything to me. 
Doctor: No problem. Going back to your list of medications, I know you took antibiotics for your infection, but did you take any medication for your sinuses? 
Patient: No, I haven't. I did try this cream for my nose, but that didn't work either. Nothing worked! 
Doctor: I see. Looks like the cream you used was a topical nasal corticosteroid. Are there any other symptoms that you have been experiencing? 
Patient: I've had some trouble with my balance, and I feel like I've lost some of my hearing. I thought this was odd since I'm only fifty years old. I think my ears felt plugged or full of air, so they just needed to pop. 
Doctor: I see. Let's perform an audiogram test to check your ears. 
Patient: Sounds good. 
Doctor: I'm seeing that you have some mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Your tympanometry seems to be normal. Your speech discrimination was also normal. 
Patient: That's reassuring. 
Doctor: I want to ask a few more questions about your ears. Do you feel any fullness or pressure?  
Patient: No, I don't feel anything like that right now. 
Doctor: Do you hear any humming, buzzing, or roaring sounds?
Patient: Nope. I don't hear anything like that. 
Doctor: We checked your ears and now understand more about the problem, but I wonder why your balance is affected. When did you start noticing your balance was affected? 
Patient: I think it could have been to this one medicine that starts with an A. I forgot the name, but it didn't really help my nasal problems. It just made my balance worse. 
Doctor: Was the medicine called Allegra? 
Patient: Oh, yeah. That's what it was called. I thought I had some sort of allergy, so I thought it would help.

Patient: Yes, the tech brought me back right before you came in. 
Doctor: Good, I have the images right here. 
Patient: What do they show, doctor?
Doctor: Well, these x rays of the neck and right shoulder show some degenerative changes, and possibly some kind of rotator cuff injury.

Actually, the main reasons we are seeing her back so soon which are elevated blood pressure and her right arm symptoms are basically resolved.  Blood pressure is better even though she is not currently on the higher dose Mavik likely recommended.  She apparently did not feel well with the higher dose, so she just went back to her previous dose of 1 mg daily.  She thinks, she also has an element of office hypertension.  Also, since she is on Mavik plus verapamil, she could switch over to the combined drug Tarka.  However, when we gave her samples of that she thought they were too big for her to swallow.  Basically, she is just back on her previous blood pressure regimen.  However, her blood pressure seems to be better today.  Her daughter says that they do check it periodically and it is similar to today's reading.  Her right arm symptoms are basically resolved and she attributed that to her muscle problem back in the right shoulder blade.  We did do a C-spine and right shoulder x-ray and those just mainly showed some degenerative changes and possibly some rotator cuff injury with the humeral head quite high up in the glenoid in the right shoulder, but this does not seem to cause her any problems.  She has some vague 'stomach problems', although apparently it is improved when she stopped Aleve and she does not have any more aches or pains off Aleve.  She takes Tylenol p.r.n., which seems to be enough for her.  She does not think she has any acid reflux symptoms or heartburn.  She does take Tums t.i.d. and also Mylanta at night.
